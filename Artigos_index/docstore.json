Although recommende d sleep duration is\nbetween 7\u20139 hours per day, many students do not sleep that much. Scholar demands are\namong the causes of observed sleep deprivation in youth. We explored the influence of hav-\ning a school test on previous night sleep in first-year students and the association of sleep\nduration and test performance. We ran two surveys in freshman students of the Universidad\nde la Repu \u00b4 blica, Montevideo, Uruguay: 1) 97 students of the School of Sciences who took\nthe test at the same time; and 2) 252 School of Psychology students who took the test in\nfour successive shifts. More than 1/2 of the participants (survey #1) and almost 1/3 (survey\n#2) reported short regular sleep duration (< 7h). In both samples, the sleep duration of the\nnight before the test was reduced with respect to regular nights (survey #1: 2.1 \u00b1 0.2 h, p <\n0.001; survey #2: between 1.7 \u00b1 0.4 h and 3.6 \u00b1 0.3 h, all p < 0.001), with more than 10% of\nthe students who did not sleep at all. In survey 2, sleep duration increased in later shifts (F\n(3,248) = 4.6, p = 0.004). Using logit regressions, we confirmed that sleep duration was posi-\ntively related to test scores in both samples (survey #1: exp B = 1.15, p < 0.001; pseudo-R\n2\n= 0.38; survey #2: exp B = 1.03, p < 0.001; pseudo-R\n2\n= 0.25). Delaying test start time may\nprevent the reduction in sleep duration, which may also improve school performance. In\naddition, educational policies should include information for students about the impact of\nsleep on learning and of the consequences of reduced sleep duration.\nIntroduction\nThere is a consensus that adults should sleep between 7\u20139 hours per day [1, 2]. Chronic short\nsleep duration is associated with an increase in several risk factors [3], and with an increase in\nthe relative risk for multiple-cause mortality [4]. However, according to the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention [5], more than 30% of American young adults report short sleep\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02471 04 March 10, 2021 1 / 9\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Estevan I, Sardi R, Tejera AC, Silva A,\nTassino B (2021) Should I study or should I go (to\nsleep)?

In\nparticular, the compromise between the natural trend of adolescents towards Eveningness and\ntheir early school schedule has been pointed out as a key factor affecting sleep duration and\nquality [10, 11]. Young college undergraduate students still exhibit a delayed chronotype [12],\nand display a shorter sleep duration when attending morning classes with respect to evening\nclasses [13].\nSleep is related to students\u2019 well-being and mental health [14\u201317]. Moreover, students\u2019 sleep\nduration, sleep pattern, and daytime sleepiness have been proved to affect their academic per-\nformance [18\u201321]. Comparing sleep problems to other factors influencing academic perfor-\nmance, Hartman & Prichard [22] found that sleep problems have similar influence in school\nretention and grades than other factors that receive more attention such as binge drinking or\ndrug consumption.\nDespite the relevance of sufficient sleep duration, there is some evidence that students\nreduce their sleep during exam periods and the night before a test [23]. An actigraphy study\nwith final-year high school students showed a reduction in sleep duration, quality, and effi-\nciency [24]. It has been interpreted that the increase in psychological distress and anxiety typi-\ncal of exams periods affect both sleep duration and quality [23\u201327]. In addition to anxiety,\nusing a survey with undergraduate students, Hartwig & Dunlosky [28] showed that more than\nhalf the participants often do all their study in one session previous to the test, and most of\nthem also \u201ccram\u201d lots of information in this previous night sacrificing sleep hours with no ben-\nefits in their performance. In a study with American college students, almost 60% of them\nreported engaging at least once in all-night study sessions, which hampered their test perfor-\nmance [29]. Orzerch et al. [30] also found better grades among students not reporting all-\nnight study sessions. However, other studies did not find an association between long night\nstudy sessions and test scores [31, 32].\nAlthough the positive association of sleep duration and academic performance seems to be\nwell established, the influence of tests on sleep is not yet fully understood, and studies about\nthe consequences of an acute sleep reduction previous to a test are scarce. In this study, we\ntook advantage of the highly populated freshman University courses of the Universidad de la\nRepu \u00b4 blica, Uruguay, that require students to take tests in different shifts. We aimed to clarify\nhow students modify their sleep habits the night before they take a test and to evaluate the\nassociation between sleep duration and academic performance.\nMaterials and methods\nWe ran two surveys in freshman students of the Universidad de la Repu \u00b4 blica, Montevideo,\nUruguay. We used a short computer-based questionnaire to ask about students\u2019 sleep pattern\n(bedtime, sleep latency, sleep end) on regular nights and the night before a mid-term test that\nwas applied immediately after students finished the test. Questionnaire also included some\nitems about socio-demographic information.\nStatistical analyses were performed in R [33] using RStudio as an integrated development\nenvironment [34]. Throughout the text sample statistics are reported as Mean \u00b1 Standard\nDeviation, while estimated differences are reported as Mean \u00b1 Standard Error. All procedures\nwere approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Psychology, Universidad de la Repu \u00b4 -\nblica, and complied with the principles outlined by the Declaration of Helsinki [35].

Although these issues\nhave been addressed in previous reports [23, 24, 31, 32], this is the first study to explore how\nsleep patterns of the night before the test change when the test is taken at different times (sur-\nvey #2). Overall (survey #1 and #2), most students delayed their bedtime the night before the\ntest, reducing their sleep duration, and more than 10% did not even sleep at all the night\nbefore. Even when the test started as late as 13:15, the sleep duration of the night before was\nshorter than in regular nights, and 10% of the students stayed awake all night. In addition,\nsleep duration was positively correlated with the number of correct answers in the test, and\ntherefore with school grades. When analyzing these effects across shifts (survey #2), we found\nthat sleep duration and academic performance improved as test start times were delayed.\nHigh rate of short regular sleep was found in both surveys, with more than 1/2 (survey #1)\nand almost 1/3 of students (survey #2) who reported sleep duration <7 h in average per night.\nThe rate of students with short regular sleep was higher and mean sleep duration was shorter\nin students of School of Science (survey #1) than in students of the Psychology School (survey\n#2), probably because the former were younger than the latter [37]. Similar values of sleep dep-\nrivation were previously reported in Uruguayan university students [38], and this should be a\nmatter of concern based on the multiple consequences of chronic inadequate sleep [14\u201317].\nTaking the test had a strong influence in the night before sleep behavior of students, a pat-\ntern that has been previously described using both actigraphy data and questionnaires in\nyoung students [23, 24].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3599, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b2e8a39-47fb-467c-b635-9fac4d6f404c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b2e8a39-47fb-467c-b635-9fac4d6f404c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "journal.pone.0247104.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/journal.pone.0247104.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 594864, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "636f8e4b-927c-4413-a583-8e739df247a6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "journal.pone.0247104.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/journal.pone.0247104.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 594864, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "09373ff71635d2b7202760c88b63cdb0d8c9901dd303b2fe9f1bd83ee248161f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "33e371df-b4f2-4abf-b22a-595de62992a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "journal.pone.0247104.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/journal.pone.0247104.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 594864, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "20785ad2fb4820105635a58c3e5d8d55cae9dd1ca655b41c2f7ad975f4914cc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "High rate of short regular sleep was found in both surveys, with more than 1/2 (survey #1)\nand almost 1/3 of students (survey #2) who reported sleep duration <7 h in average per night.\nThe rate of students with short regular sleep was higher and mean sleep duration was shorter\nin students of School of Science (survey #1) than in students of the Psychology School (survey\n#2), probably because the former were younger than the latter [37].

In Uruguay, grades use a non-linear scale from 0 to 12. The fair lowest passing\ngrade is 3 and corresponds to 60% achievement, while 90% achievement corresponds to grade\n10. This complexity of the Uruguayan grading system prevented us from using grades in\nregressions.

Scullin [45] found a\nsimilar result using actigraphy data and showing that long-sleep students outperform short-\nsleep students in tests scores. The difference between surveys in regression coefficients and\nexplained deviance may be related with the different type of questions (true/false vs multiple\nchoice) employed in both courses, as the probability of answering correctly at random is\nhigher in true-false type questions.\nSchool and test shifts, an obligated solution to the insufficient universities\u2019 infrastructure to\ndeal with the progressively increasing number of students in many countries [46], can also be\nseen as an opportunistic tool to deepen the study of the influence of test start time on sleep and\nperformance [47\u201349].

A previous study in Brazilian undergraduate stu-\ndents attending school in different shifts found a similar pattern [13]: sleep duration was lon-\nger in students of the afternoon-shift with respect to morning-shift ones. We also found that\nstudents\u2019 performance was significantly higher in later shifts with respect to early ones. The\nenhanced performance of late-shift students is more likely due to their longer sleep duration\nand not to the time spent studying the day before the test, which was not significantly different\nacross shifts. In addition to longer sleep durations, chronotype-associated differences in per-\nformance may also contribute to the differences observed between shifts [50, 51]. To address\nthis issue in the future, we plan to add the assessment of Morningness-Eveningn ess in students\nof the Psychology School taking tests in different shifts.\nOur study has several limitations. Self-report questionnaires may overestimate sleep dura-\ntion compared to objective measures [52], and short sleep prevalence may be even higher than\nreported among Uruguayan college students. Although data were collected immediately after\nthe test to prevent memory blurring, future studies should include more objective measures to\nconfirm our results. A previous study using actigraphy data found a similar pattern of sleep\nreduction during exam period [45]. Sleep disturbance and reduced performance may be both\nassociated with the high levels of anxiety prior to a test [53]. However, we did not observe an\nincrease in sleep latency before the test, a measure that has been related to anxiety levels [14,\n54]. Nevertheless, the analysis of personality-linked variables could help to get a better under-\nstanding of the interaction between students\u2019 sleep behavior and study practice before a test.\nIn this study, we show that many college students reported not getting enough sleep. In\naddition, we found that taking a test influences students\u2019 sleep behavior, and that the sleep\nduration of the night before the test is associated with test performance. Given the relevance of\nadequate sleep, it appears as a cost-efficient way to improve student\u2019s academic performance\nand well-being [21, 55]. Although delaying school (and tests) start times has been related to\nlonger sleep duration and better academic performance, it seems not enough. These evidence\nshould inspire educational policies and promote an open communication of the impact of\nsleep on learning and of the consequences of reduced sleep duration.\nAcknowledgmen ts\nWe thank everyone who participated in this study.

The key question was: \nHow do the PhD students describe experiences specifi-\ncally in relation to perceived potential as teachers of grad-\nuate students in higher education? Although the primary \npurpose of the self-study was to inform the research site \nand improve teaching practices locally, findings from this \nself-study will help further the recent interest in examin-\ning graduate programs in music education (Rutkowski, \nWebster, & Gossett, 2012, 2013). It is also hoped that the \napproach to self-study described here may encourage \nother researchers in different teaching contexts to study \ntheir own practices through similar techniques.\nIn The Formation of Scholars: Rethinking Doctoral \nEducation for the Twenty-first Century, Walker, Golde, \nJones, Bueschel, and Hutchings (2008) outlined the many \ncomplexities involved in preparing the next generation of \nscholars.

Walker et\n \nal. (2008) stated,\nFaculty members must be willing to ask for help, which \nrequires some humility and vulnerability, but has the payoff \nof becoming a better mentor. . . . Faculty and students alike \ncan begin by examining what they do now and assessing \nwhether it works. (p. 115)\nFirst and foremost, we urge faculty to see the doctoral \neducation experience through the eyes of a student. Ask \nyourself the questions about your doctoral program that you \nwould expect a student to ask. And ask the students \nthemselves! . . . We encourage you to turn your scholarly \nlenses on the experiences of students in your programs. This \nmight mean careful one-on-one conversations, more \nsystematic surveys and focus groups, or regular town \nmeetings where students are seriously listened to.

We framed our work around the \nkey question: How do PhD students describe experiences specifically in relation to perceived potential as teachers of \ngraduate students in higher education? Findings concerning graduate teaching included (a) views of graduate teaching \nchanged with increased experience, and (b) confidence increased with more experience teaching graduate classes \nand more time to process the content.

The committee stated that finding a \nbalance between music and professional education \ncoursework was a key challenge in both master\u2019s and \ndoctoral degrees. There was little discussion in this article \non the topic of research or the creation of scholars and \nteacher educators. However, the article does mention that \ndoctoral students should be familiar with the \u201cinstru-\nments of research\u201d (p. 168), including proficiency in mul-\ntiple foreign languages.\nIn a Music Educators Journal article, Ball et\n \nal. (1980) \npresented the report of the MENC Commission on \nGraduate Music Teacher Education submitted at the con-\nclusion of a 4-year focus by the commission. They dis-\ncussed graduate teacher education function, curricula, \nfaculty, admissions, resources, and the role of research. \nThe role of research section suggested that students in the \nmaster\u2019s program should experience \u201cguided interpreta-\ntion\u201d and \u201cpractical application\u201d (p. 48), while doctoral \nstudents must balance research and music requirements. \nThe authors heavily criticized the profession for not pro-\nducing qualified researchers at the time. This article  \nprovides a strong reference list of key historic articles on \ngraduate education and research within music education, \nincluding Britton (1969), Cady (1965), Leonhard and \nColwell (1976), and Petzold (1964).\nWithin music teacher education, a Preparing Teacher \nEducators Area for Strategic Planning and Action has \nbeen formed within the Society for Music Teacher \nEducation to examine doctoral programs (Rutkowski, \nHewitt, Taggart, & Weaver, 2007). Rutkowski et\n \nal. \n(2007) presented an extensive overview of current prac-\ntices in doctoral education including: (a) identification \nand recruitment of potential doctoral students; (b) suc-\ncessful mentoring of doctoral students; (c) working with \nfaculty to develop skills in teaching college students, \nincluding having opportunities teaching college classes; \n(d) sharing the job search process and providing mock-\ninterview and dossier-compilation experiences; (e) men-\ntoring students as researchers prior to dissertation work; \nand (f) developing a sense of a community of scholars \namong doctoral students and music education faculty.\nRobinson and Taggart (2011) conducted interviews \nwith eight recent music education PhD graduates of \nMichigan State University to describe what graduates \nbelieved had helped to prepare them for their roles as \nnew faculty members. They learned that a flat hierarchi-\ncal structure (between students and faculty) that involves \nan \u201cethic of care\u201d (Robinson & Taggart, 2011, p. 17) \namong faculty and peers was perceived as valuable. \nRobinson and Taggart also documented the importance \nof collegiality and collaboration among the doctoral stu-\ndents, accessibility to faculty for mentoring, and shared \nthat doctoral students valued learning experiences that \nwere well balanced between teaching and research/\nscholarly activities. Finally, the expectation to conduct, \npresent, and publish research emerged as an essential \nand valuable part of the learning community culture.\nMethod\nThis inquiry drew from a self-study of teacher education \nresearch approach (Loughran, 2004, 2007; Russell & \nLoughran, 2007; Samaras, 2011).

At the time of the study, graduate students assisted \nfaculty in teaching all of the undergraduate courses as \nwell as observing student teachers.

Once I \nbecame a doctoral student, I began to think of myself as a \nfuture professor, but of undergraduates. I had previous \nexperiences working with preservice teachers during field-\nwork or student teaching and because of those experiences \nand my knowledge of teaching within K\u201312 schools, I felt \nconfident of my abilities as a future teacher educator.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had opportunities to think about that, to do \nthat [work with graduate students]\u201d (Focus Group, \nOctober, 2011). In the beginning of our study, I had sev-\neral preconceptions and fears of working with graduate \nstudents. I felt that graduate instruction was mostly dis-\ncussion based, often without any predetermined plan of \nconversation. I worried that I would not know enough \ninformation to be able to cover every possible area of dis-\ncussion and would appear ill equipped to lead the class. \nMy worry of \u201cAm I going to know enough\u201d (Focus \nGroup, October, 2010) initially affected my collaboration \nwith the participants for our Action Research study. After \nour first meeting with the participants, I reflected,\nWhat am I doing here? That is the question that kept going \nthrough my mind during the entire meeting. I haven\u2019t even \nstarted my doctorate, which puts me on equal footing with \nour participating teachers. In fact, I felt behind them because \ntwo of them (I think) had written theses, which gives a pretty \ngood feeling for the whole dissertation process. They had \ncompleted their own studies, and I had not. What am I going \nto contribute? (Journal, August, 2010)\nThroughout the study, I observed the manner in which \nmy professors interacted with me and delivered content \nin class. I emulated some of these behaviors when I \nworked with the teacher participants from our Action \nResearch/Teacher Research study. Midway through the \nstudy, I started teaching a music technology course at the \nuniversity. In my class of 10, two were master\u2019s students. \nIn my effort to tailor the class to serve the needs of all of \nmy students, I worked hard to design both undergraduate \n(i.e., skills based) and graduate (i.e., reflective, discus-\nsion based) activities. What struck me during this class, \nhowever, was that my teaching mannerisms (e.g., body \nlanguage, use of questions, and tone of voice) with the \nundergraduates did not feel different from my interac-\ntions with the graduate students.\nAs we conclude our data collection for this self-study, I \nhave come to the following conclusions based on my few \ngraduate teaching experiences: \u201cThere\u2019s an art form to \nteaching graduate students just like there is to teaching any \nother level\u201d (Focus Group, October, 2010). I believe that \nteaching graduate students is different from teaching under-\ngraduate students, though I think the differences are subtle. \nAs in all classes, an instructor\u2019s delivery can influence a \nstudent\u2019s receptivity of the content matter.

What a compliment!\nAfter another year of coursework and study of con-\nstructivist approaches to teaching, I had two more oppor-\ntunities to teach in the summer master\u2019s program. Rather \nthan viewing my presentations as opportunities to express \nmy knowledge of the material (i.e., authoritative \napproach), I began to recognize the value of allowing \nspace for students to share their views and knowledge of \nthe topic. This allayed fears about an insufficient knowl-\nedge base and refocused my mindset on creating a class-\nroom that values student input and inquiry.\nSteve.\n Originally\n, teaching graduate students was incred-\nibly intimidating and I equated it with the experience of \nteaching P\u201312 instrumental music for the first time. As I \ngained more experience teaching graduate (or graduate \nage/level of experience) students, I came to trust myself \nand teach them as adults and not as I would undergradu-\nates. Toward the beginning of my graduate teaching \nexperiences I felt intimidated by their age and experi-\nence: \u201cThese teachers have a lot of expertise and the \nthought of \u2018who am I to offer them advice\u2019 came up in my \nmind\u201d (Journal, October, 2010). As I progressed, I real-\nized their age and experience affected how I designed my \nlessons and how I interacted with them; I began to see \ntheir experience as a strength and less as an intimidator. I \nrelated this experience to how I progressed teaching \nundergraduate students: \u201cWith undergraduates I feel like \nI teach them the \u2018what,\u2019 with the graduates I\u2019m exploring \nthe \u2018how\u2019 and the \u2018why\u2019 and relying on what they are \nbringing to the table\u201d (Individual Interview, July, 2011).\nI started designing my graduate teaching experiences \nrelying on what was comfortable (teaching undergradu-\nates and P\u201312) and what was modeled for me (college \nprofessors). As I gained experience I realized that what I \ndesign for graduates to do in class and how I approach \nthem did change.\nI\u2019m going to go back to my comfort zone, which is how I \nwould teach an undergrad class, and adjust things from \nthere. . . . I\u2019m going to draw on my success in teaching \nundergrad classes, but draw on my experiences teaching \nthese little graduate units and try to meld the two. (Individual \nInterview, July, 2011)\nI incorporated more interactive activities, focused more \non what they bring to the classroom and less on a pre-\nscribed curriculum. \u201cI realized the power of engaging \nthem to talk to each other. Tapping into their prior experi-\nence is what made the session fly!\u201d (Journal, June, 2011).\nConfidence Increased With More Experience \nTeaching Graduate Classes and With More \nTime to Process the Graduate \u201cContent\u201d\nElle. I still worry about knowing enough material to \neffectively work with graduate students. Am I studying \nthe \n\u201cright\u201d subjects? Is my education diverse enough? As \nI have come to realize over the course of this project, I \nfeel comfortable working with graduate students when I \nfeel comfortable with the content. I am more comfortable \nteaching the content covered in an undergraduate degree \nbecause I have taught it and know it well. However, I also \nfelt comfortable leading a summer workshop of graduate \nstudents and veteran teachers because I knew the content. \nBecause I was confident with the subject matter, I was \nable to relinquish class control, I was comfortable facili-\ntating discussion and asking my students to share their \nideas and past successes.

Aside from teaching the technology course and the \nsummer workshop, I have only had \u201cone shot\u201d experi\n-\nences working with graduate classes. This summer, I was \na guest in the summer master\u2019s beginning research class. \nI presented an overview of how to locate research sources, \nleading students through various computer search engines \nand citation software.

I also wonder if it is because the content \ndid not feel like what I envisioned myself teaching to \ngraduate students. I wonder if I would have felt similarly \nif I presented on, for example, research methodologies or \nlearning styles.\nMatt.\n Just as a conductor must practice in front of the \nensemble to improve his or her interactions with the \nensemble, practicing teaching is necessary to gain confi\n-\ndence, increase self-efficacy, and improve one\u2019s teaching \nability. It is hard to chart one\u2019s growth as a teacher of \ngraduate students without successive teaching opportuni-\nties. I found that each time I worked with the same group \nof students in the summer master\u2019s program, my teaching \nimproved because I was more familiar with each stu-\ndent\u2019s background, interests, and experience.

Indeed, it is plau-\nsible that as much, if not more, learning takes place \noutside the classroom as inside the classroom. As a \nresult, equipping students with effective study strategies \nis vital to their educational success. Fortunately, recent \ninterest in applying cognitive principles to enhance \neducational practices has produced a substantial litera-\nture on effective study strategies. A number of reviews \nhave been published on empirically supported tech-\nniques by both cognitive and educational psychologists \n(Dunlosky, Rawson, Marsh, Nathan, & Willingham, \n2013; Fiorella & Mayer, 2015; Mayer, 2008; Roediger & \nPyc, 2012). Thus, the good news is that there are potent \nstudy strategies that can help students learn more effi-\ncaciously. The bad news, however, is that students do \nnot often use the learning strategies that cognitive \nresearchers have identified as being effective (Hartwig \n& Dunlosky, 2012; Karpicke, Butler, & Roediger, 2009; \nKornell & Bjork, 2007; Wissman, Rawson, & Pyc, 2012; \nYan, Thai, & Bjork, 2014). Self-report questionnaires \ntypically find that students are not aware of the effec-\ntiveness of potent evidence-based study strategies and \nthus do not regularly implement them (McCabe, 2011). \nIn addition, empirical studies suggest that students seek \nconditions that maximize their perceived understanding \nof the material at the moment of study rather than \nconditions that maximize their learning as indexed by \nlater test results (for additional discussion on the distinc-\ntion between performance and learning, see Soderstrom \n& Bjork, 2015). That is, students want to see rapid gains \nwhen they are studying and erroneously take these \ngains as actual understanding, thus preferring whatever \nstudy strategies support rapid gains.\nStudents appear to hold strong preferences for study \ntechniques that they have used throughout their edu-\ncational careers; consequently, attempts to sell them on \nnew strategies may be met with resistance. Accordingly, \nwe suggest that a fruitful alternative approach is to \nexamine the effectiveness of the study strategies that \nstudents regularly implement and identify ways to aug-\nment these preferred study strategies. As a first step, \nwe review the empirical evidence on the effectiveness \nof the study strategies that students actually use.

McDaniel\nDepartment of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis\nAbstract\nResearchers\u2019 and educators\u2019 enthusiasm in applying cognitive principles to enhance educational practices has become \nmore evident. Several published reviews have suggested that some potent strategies can help students learn more \nefficaciously. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, students do not report frequent reliance on these empirically supported \ntechniques. In the present review, we take a novel approach, identifying study strategies for which students have strong \npreferences and assessing whether these preferred strategies have any merit given existing empirical evidence from the \ncognitive and educational literatures. Furthermore, we provide concrete recommendations for students, instructors, and \npsychologists. For students, we identify common pitfalls and tips for optimal implementation for each study strategy. \nFor instructors, we provide recommendations for how they can assist students to more optimally implement these study \nstrategies. For psychologists, we highlight promising avenues of research to help augment these study strategies.\nKeywords\nstudy strategies, self-regulated learning, education", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4329, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4813ed3-b7f6-4610-84c0-f1a00e5e7af5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4813ed3-b7f6-4610-84c0-f1a00e5e7af5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "391", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "15eab8d7-b8b2-496e-9e81-867303a16cce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "391", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "522ab0a72eeb755e7b340961dbd5b20c432f030c46c5134fa431b3d150a0d108", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c942e1d-07c2-42f4-a541-a1c538f5f3fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa87f2fdbf990785d42534e1d14ec59fd6158a036ad318d9a9d878e498a02fba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Five Popular Study Strategies 391\nexamination of students\u2019 self-reported study strategies \nyielded five popular strategies that students routinely \nprefer: (a) rereading, (b) highlighting or underlining, (c) \nnote-taking, (d) outlining, and (e) using flash cards \n(Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012; Karpicke et\u00a0al., 2009; Kornell \n& Bjork, 2007; Wissman et\u00a0al., 2012; Yan et\u00a0al., 2014); \ncasual observation on any college campus confirms \nthese findings (for a summary of the frequency of use \nof these top five strategies, see Table 1).\nAlthough a couple of these strategies (i.e., rereading \nand highlighting or underlining) have been reviewed \nelsewhere, they have typically been assessed relative to \nmore effective strategies. For instance, Dunlosky et\u00a0al. \n(2013) gave rereading and highlighting or underlining \na low utility rating relative to other more potent tech-\nniques, such as testing and spaced practice. To a casual \nreader, this overall assessment suggests that rereading \nand highlighting or underlining should not be used in \nany educational context. Furthermore, because Dunlosky \net\u00a0al. focused on the general utility of these study strate-\ngies, they might have overlooked the possibility that \nthese study strategies may be particularly effective (or \ncommonly misused) in certain situations. Thus, less \nemphasis has been placed on how effective these strate-\ngies are relative to no study strategy. All five of the \npopular study strategies being reviewed here can be \npotent when properly used. Thus, a primary purpose \nof the present review is to emphasize the conditions \nunder which these popular techniques do and do not \nfoster effective learning and highlight ways in which \nthey can be precisely prescribed.\nWe will cover each study strategy in turn, and each \nstudy-strategy section is organized into three subsec-\ntions: effective implementations, ineffective implementa-\ntions, and educational recommendations . We anticipate \nthat this review will be beneficial for a wide audience, \nincluding students, educators, and psychologists. For \nstudents and educators, this review will shed some light \non how and when these popular study strategies should \nbe implemented to get the most from students\u2019 study \ntime. With this purpose in mind, the Introduction and \nthe Educational Recommendation subsections of each \nof the five sections are written with minimal technical \nterminology. For psychologists, our hope is that this \nreview will create excitement about new lines of \nresearch on study strategies that are both theoretically \ninteresting and\u2014perhaps more important\u2014educationally \nmotivated.\nRereading\nA straightforward assumption is that rereading texts \nshould yield benefits of repetition similar to that gener-\nally found in list-learning experiments (i.e., multiple \nexposures of words lead to better recall than a single \nexposure; e.g., Tulving, 1966; but for an interesting \nexception, see Mulligan & Peterson, 2015). Yet this \nassumption has not been investigated as extensively as \none would imagine, given the popularity of rereading \nas a study strategy (e.g., Karpicke et\u00a0al., 2009). Since \nthe 1970s, cognitive and educational psychologists have \ntypically endorsed study strategies that require active \nprocessing of complex materials such as texts (Segal, \nChipman, & Glaser, 1985; Weinstein, Goetz, & Alexander, \n1988; Wittrock, 1974). Thus, research on rereading has \noften taken a backseat to research focusing on more \nactive study strategies because rereading may be pas-\nsive in nature, at least in the manner in which students \ndo it (for a different perspective based on laboratory \nstudies, see Stine-Morrow, Gagne, Morrow, & DeWall, \n2004). We posit that this may be the same reason why \nrereading is so popular among students. Because \nrereading does not necessarily require active and effort-\nful processing of the text, it gives students the (false) \nsense that they are effectively learning the text (Roediger \n& Karpicke, 2006b; although see Rawson, Dunlosky, & \nThiede, 2000). That is, the second reading of a text feels \nmore fluent than the first reading, and the increased \nfluency is perceived by students, accurately or inac-\ncurately, as an indication of successful learning (Rawson \n& Dunlosky, 2002).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4274, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c942e1d-07c2-42f4-a541-a1c538f5f3fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c942e1d-07c2-42f4-a541-a1c538f5f3fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "391", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "15eab8d7-b8b2-496e-9e81-867303a16cce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "391", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "522ab0a72eeb755e7b340961dbd5b20c432f030c46c5134fa431b3d150a0d108", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4813ed3-b7f6-4610-84c0-f1a00e5e7af5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "391", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "cfc3c9206cc23f75aa281526a2e7ade9a68430f84046228ce67b023f392fe416", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We posit that this may be the same reason why \nrereading is so popular among students.

In addition, this finding \nhas been extended to text materials. For instance, \nGlover and Corkill (1987) had students read short para-\ngraphs twice with either an immediate lag (massed \ngroup) or a 30-min lag (spaced group). They found that \nthe spaced group was able to recall more of the content \nthan the massed group on an immediate free-recall test \n(see also Krug, Davis, & Glover, 1990). However, Verkoeijen, \nRikers, and Ozsoy (2008) found that too much spacing can \nbe detrimental for text learning. Specifically, they com-\npared a massed reread group with both a shorter-spaced \nreread group (i.e., 4 days) and a longer-spaced reread \ngroup (i.e., 3.5 weeks) and found that only the shorter-\nspaced reread group outperformed the massed reread \ngroup on a free-recall test after a 48-hr delay. The longer-\nspaced reread group was only able to recall as many \ndetails as the massed reread group, which suggests that \nthe benefits of spacing diminish when the lag is too long.\nTo determine an optimal lag between the first and \nsecond readings, one must consider the retention inter -\nval. To this end, Rawson and Kintsch (2005) imple-\nmented a factorial design manipulating both lag and \nretention interval in four conditions: (a) immediate lag \nand immediate retention interval, (b) immediate lag and \ndelayed retention interval, (c) long lag and immediate \nretention interval, and (d) long lag and delayed reten-\ntion interval (see also Rawson, 2012). Their results indi-\ncated that long lags with a delayed retention interval \nbenefited test performance (relative to a single read-\ning), but long lags with an immediate retention interval \nyielded no benefits. Instead, with an immediate reten-\ntion interval, the immediate lag but not the long lag \ncondition yielded superior performance relative to a \nsingle reading. These results suggest that long lags \nbetween reading opportunities are vital for producing \nmore durable learning (i.e., performance on delayed \ntests) relative to a single reading. However, under cer-\ntain conditions (e.g., immediate tests), massed reread-\ning may actually be more beneficial than spaced \nrereading.1\nIneffective implementation\nAs we have discussed above, spacing out the first and \nsecond readings is beneficial for long-term retention of \nthe studied information. On the flip side, massing the \nreadings (or cramming) has been shown to produce \nlimited benefits (Rawson, 2012; Rawson & Kintsch, \n2005). Unless the test is going to take place immediately \nafter the second reading (which is unlikely in educa-\ntional settings), it is not recommended that students \nengage in massed rereading.\nFurthermore, although rereading has been shown to \nproduce robust benefits for free recall and cued-recall \ntests (particularly if the readings are spaced apart), its \nbenefits for higher order assessments (e.g., application-\nbased, inference-based, or problem-solving tests) are \nless clear. Callender and McDaniel (2009) had partici-\npants read authentic textbook chapters either once or \ntwice and found that (relative to a single reading) \nrereading did not improve performance on short-\nanswer application questions or summary writing. How-\never, Karpicke and Blunt (2011) compared groups that \nhad different numbers of reading opportunities (i.e., \none or four) and found that rereading enhanced per-\nformance for inference multiple-choice and short-\nanswer application tests relative to a single reading. It \nis important to note that participants in the Karpicke \nand Blunt study were allowed to restudy the passage \nfour times, and the passages were much shorter (i.e., \napproximately 300 words) than those typically assigned \nin college classes.

However, its \nbenefits can be enhanced. For immediate tests, massed \nrereading is an effective strategy for helping learners \npick up additional details and facts that might have \nbeen missed during the first reading (Amlund, Kardash, \n& Kulhavy, 1986; Barnett & Seefeldt, 1989; Glover & \nCorkill, 1987; Haenggi & Perfetti, 1992; but see Callender \n& McDaniel, 2009). Thus, for assessments that require \nmemorization of key information, rereading can be an \neffective study strategy. However, for assessments that \nrequire students to integrate key information and make \ninferences from the texts, rereading appears to be less \neffective. Another takeaway is that spaced rereading is \nuseful for producing durable learning in educational \nsettings; durable learning is important when studying \nfor comprehensive exams later in the semester, forming \na strong foundation for future coursework that builds \non prior classes, or preparing for a standardized test \nthat covers an array of content (e.g., SAT, MCAT, GRE). \nOn the other hand, if the goal is to do well on an \nimmediate exam, then rereading right before the exam \n(cramming) may be sufficient.\nIn addition, retrieving the read contents before \nrereading bolsters learning (McDaniel, Howard, &  \nEinstein, 2009), probably because the retrieval attempt", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3268, "end_char_idx": 5602, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6dcd9097-7bfb-427f-b383-b080227e9ed0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6dcd9097-7bfb-427f-b383-b080227e9ed0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "393", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2b6c2d33-9575-44f0-9ab5-8d99062579ee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "393", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "7b94faea93f368617adeda54ff4ad1f7069e08e625efcd7b6b4461814dbe8b61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc8dc388-3252-42a3-8125-64b30c296f65", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6942b4e3611267bef6f74a7137dbe37107f30515e2a80bbff771b020aa449023", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Five Popular Study Strategies 393\nprovides learners with feedback about what they know \nand do not know (Little & McDaniel, 2015). This \nincreased metacognitive accuracy can guide more effec-\ntive and focused rereading during further study com-\npared with additional retrieval practice (McDaniel, \nBugg, Liu, & Brick, 2015, Experiment 2). Simply recom-\nmending to students that they incorporate retrieval \npractice into their study routines may not prompt much \nchange in students\u2019 study activities. For example, even \nwhen an instructor set up an online quiz and told his \nstudents about the benefit of practice testing, his stu-\ndents\u2019 participation in the practice testing was very poor \n(Trumbo, Leiting, McDaniel, & Hodge, 2016). However, \nencouraging students to incorporate retrieval practice \ninto their preexisting routine, such as rereading, might \nmeet with less resistance from students (see also the \nGeneral Discussion section).\nThe effectiveness of rereading might be further \nenhanced by training students on reading strategies. \nFor instance, McNamara, O\u2019Reilly, Best, and Ozuru \n(2006) provided students with a computerized trainer \ncalled Interactive Strategy Trainer for Active Reading \nand Thinking (iSTART), which consisted of an interac-\ntive agent training students on self-explanation and five \nreading strategies (i.e., comprehension monitoring, \nparaphrasing, prediction, elaboration, and bridging). \nThey found that iSTART improved students\u2019 reading \ncomprehension relative to that of a group of students \nwho just received a brief demonstration of how to self-\nexplain texts. Although these results suggest that \nrereading might not be necessary if the reader can \nsuccessfully comprehend the text the first time around, \nwe posit that rereading can be leveraged to improve \nstudying if students are more skilled at particular \naspects of reading, most notably metacomprehension. \nThat is, if students were able to accurately monitor their \ncomprehension while reading (e.g., after some training \nsuch as iSTART), rereading would presumably be more \neffective because it could target the missing gaps in the \nstudent\u2019s knowledge.\nUnderlining and Highlighting (Marking)\nUnderlining or highlighting parts of a text is one of the \nmost popular study strategies among students because \nof its ease of use (Cioffi, 1986; Gurung, Weidert, & Jeske, \n2010). The belief that this strategy can improve compre-\nhension is so pervasive that even as early as the 5th grade, \nstudents spontaneously underline (Brown & Smiley, 1978). \nBoth underlining and highlighting are believed to benefit \nlearning in two ways: (a) Selecting what is important in \nthe text elicits elaborative thinking (generative function), \nand (b) underlining and highlighting important sections \nmakes it easier to identify them later (storage function). \nBecause underlining and highlighting essentially func-\ntion through the same mechanism, we will hereafter refer \nto them collectively as marking for brevity.\nThe literature on marking largely consists of two \ntypes of experimental designs: learner-generated mark-\ning and experimenter-provided marking. In learner-\ngenerated-marking experiments, participants mark texts \nas they read, whereas in experimenter-generated-marking \nexperiments, participants read texts that are already \nmarked. We will focus primarily on the learner-generated \nmarking research to assess the effectiveness of marking as \na self-regulated study strategy, but we supplement our \nliterature review with research from experimenter-provided \nand other marking research, where appropriate.\nEffective implementation\nLearner-generated marking has been shown to be effec-\ntive for a variety of assessments, such as multiple-choice \ntests (e.g., Leutner, Leopold, & Den Elzen-Rump, 2007), \nfree-recall tests (Rickards & August, 1975), short-answer \ntests (Amer, 1994; Blanchard & Mikkelson, 1987), fill-\nin-the-blank tests (Yue, Storm, Kornell, & Bjork, 2015), \nand essay questions (Annis & Davis, 1978; Davis & \nAnnis, 1978; but see Idstein & Jenkins, 1972; Rickards \n& Denner, 1979; Todd & Kessler, 1971).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4122, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc8dc388-3252-42a3-8125-64b30c296f65": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc8dc388-3252-42a3-8125-64b30c296f65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "393", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2b6c2d33-9575-44f0-9ab5-8d99062579ee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "393", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "7b94faea93f368617adeda54ff4ad1f7069e08e625efcd7b6b4461814dbe8b61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6dcd9097-7bfb-427f-b383-b080227e9ed0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "393", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "1c546102adf5b956a46b92eeb2216d9178d19588291e1311400e3952064fd1e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Effective implementation\nLearner-generated marking has been shown to be effec-\ntive for a variety of assessments, such as multiple-choice \ntests (e.g., Leutner, Leopold, & Den Elzen-Rump, 2007), \nfree-recall tests (Rickards & August, 1975), short-answer \ntests (Amer, 1994; Blanchard & Mikkelson, 1987), fill-\nin-the-blank tests (Yue, Storm, Kornell, & Bjork, 2015), \nand essay questions (Annis & Davis, 1978; Davis & \nAnnis, 1978; but see Idstein & Jenkins, 1972; Rickards \n& Denner, 1979; Todd & Kessler, 1971).\nThere is strong evidence from experimenter-provided \nmarking studies that students can recall the marked \ninformation better than unmarked information (Blalick, \nBlalick, & Wark, 1977; Cashen & Leicht, 1970; Crouse \n& Idstein, 1972; Hartley, Bartlett, & Branthwaite, 1980; \nKlare, Mabry, & Gustafson, 1955; Leicht & Cashen, 1972; \nLorch, Lorch, & Klusewitz, 1995; Nist & Hogrebe, 1987). \nMoreover, evidence from studies of learner-generated \nmarking is consistent with this trend (Blanchard & \nMikkelson, 1987; Fowler & Barker, 1974).\nThe question, then, is this: Can students accurately \nselect and mark important information? There seems to \nbe great variability in students\u2019 abilities to effectively \nmark texts.

Withholding marking \nuntil after an initial read allows the learner to use the first \nread to identify the key points to be marked, thus eliciting \nactive, elaborative processing of the text. Typically, mark-\ning training is conducted in a class format or as a group \nlesson, but it can also be computerized (Leutner et\u00a0al., \n2007). Although relatively extensive training (five 90-min \nsessions) has been successfully conducted (Amer, 1994), \na 1- or 2-hr training session can be enough to produce \nbenefits (Leutner et\u00a0al., 2007; Schnell & Rocchio, 1978).\nAnother approach to improve the effectiveness of \nmarking is through training focused on the text struc-\nture (i.e., how the text is organized). Meyer, Young, and \nBartlett (1989/2014) showed that teaching students how \nto outline effectively by identifying various text struc-\ntures made them able to mark more main ideas than \ndetails, a tendency displayed by more expert readers \nwith high vocabulary and higher education (e.g., Meyer \n& Rice, 1989). More detailed discussions on text struc-\nture and its relevance to study strategy training will be \nprovided later in the Outlining section.\nThere appears to be an interesting inverse relation-\nship between students\u2019 inclination for marking and the \nbenefits they receive from marking. For example, Annis \nand Davis (1978; Davis & Annis, 1978) found that stu-\ndents who did not prefer marking as a study strategy \nactually benefited more from marking. Likewise, Yue \net\u00a0al. (2015) showed that students who were unsure \nabout the benefits of marking benefited more from \nmarking. A potential explanation for this finding is that \nlearners who are unaccustomed to marking put more \neffort in selecting which information is important, \nresulting in better retention. These findings are discour-\naging because they suggest that students who endorse \nthis popular study strategy and probably engage in it \nmore frequently are probably not using it optimally.\nIneffective implementation\nConsidering the storage function discussed earlier, one \nmight assume that the benefit of marking may be magni-\nfied if a brief review of the marked text occurs before the \nfinal test. In fact, reviewing of marked parts of the text is \nextremely popular (Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012; Kornell & \nBjork, 2007; Yan et\u00a0al., 2014). However, the literature \nindicates that reviewing does not add to the benefits of \nmarking. Many studies have shown the benefits of mark-\ning without a review (e.g., Fass & Schumacher, 1978; \nKulhavy, Dyer, & Silver, 1975; Rickards & August, 1975), \nbut several studies have failed to show benefits even with \na review (e.g., Hoon, 1974; Idstein & Jenkins, 1972; Nist \n& Hogrebe, 1987). In these studies, the control condition \nwas to review unmarked material. Marking with a review \ndid not add benefits above and beyond the generative \nbenefits associated with marking during initial reading.\nYounger students failed consistently to benefit from \nmarking without preexperiment training on how to \neffectively mark texts. Two studies targeting students \nwho were younger than college age failed to show any \nbenefits (high school students: Mathews, 1938; 10-year-\nolds: Rickards & Denner, 1979). Likewise, no published \nstudy has shown that students younger than college age \nbenefit from marking without preexperiment training. \nIn addition, Schellings, Van Hout-Wolters, and Vermunt \n(1996) asked 10th graders to mark texts either by main \npoints, points portrayed as important by the teacher, \nor whatever they found interesting, and students were \nlargely unable to adjust their marking. In contrast, \nexperimenter-provided marking research has shown \nbenefits in younger students (high school students: \nBlalick et\u00a0al., 1977; 6th graders: Hartley et\u00a0al., 1980).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4011, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aeed65e5-ea14-49e0-8bcd-ed69a8174df7": {"__data__": {"id_": "aeed65e5-ea14-49e0-8bcd-ed69a8174df7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "394", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bebb7d62-5647-4c7d-850f-eca6c83ac433", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "394", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "88ff10257496cfa7893c0cde5d438f58d20cd8dc01e0359d737aca9aaeb61ece", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2de126a5-ead8-4f91-a901-fe9f5fe918f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "394", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "2e5484b1eef37903a6eea03240b9eda57427dbb881be01a27b5e3c90d5131a25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Two studies targeting students \nwho were younger than college age failed to show any \nbenefits (high school students: Mathews, 1938; 10-year-\nolds: Rickards & Denner, 1979).

The popularity of note-taking stems \nfrom the fact that it holds the appeal of both encoding \nbenefits and storage benefits. Similar to marking, \nencoding benefits refer to the benefits associated with \nthe act of taking notes, whereas storage benefits refer \nto the benefits associated with being able to review the \nnotes (Di Vesta & Gray, 1972). The majority of the research \nconducted on note-taking has focused on the encoding \nbenefits, so the present review will mostly focus on these \nbenefits. Nevertheless, we will also discuss relevant find-\nings pertaining to the storage benefits and potential \ninteractions between the note-taking strategies and stor-\nage function.\nEffective implementation\nNote-taking has been shown to be an effective strategy \nfor both text and lecture learning, particularly when \nlearners are engaging in generative processes while \ntaking notes. Summarizing, paraphrasing, organizing, \nor outlining (see the Outlining section) the presented \ncontent has been shown to be especially helpful for \nthe retention of target information (Bretzing & Kulhavy, \n1979; Di Vesta & Gray, 1972; Einstein, Morris, & Smith, \n1985; Peper & Mayer, 1978). For instance, Howe (1970) \nfound that students who took efficient notes (fewer \nwords to express critical ideas) were more likely to \nrecall the critical information than students who took \ninefficient notes (more words to express critical ideas). \nMore recently, Bui, Myerson, and Hale (2013) demon-\nstrated that students who were instructed to take orga-\nnized notes on a computer while viewing a lecture were \nable to recall more information on a delayed test than \nthose who were instructed to transcribe (even though \nmore notes were recorded under transcription instruc-\ntions). Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) had partici-\npants listen to a TED talk and take notes by hand or \nby computer. They found that those who took notes on \na computer produced a higher quantity of notes but \nthat these notes were more likely to be verbatim. As a \nresult, learners who took notes on a computer per-\nformed worse on a final conceptual test than those who \ntook notes by hand.\nIt is important that this advantage of generative note-\ntaking over verbatim note-taking might not hold up \nwhen students are allowed to review their notes, and \nreviewing is crucial in reaping the full benefits of note-\ntaking (see the Educational Recommendations section). \nOn the one hand, the participants in Bui et\u00a0al. (2013) \nwho were instructed to take verbatim notes outper -\nformed another group of participants who were \ninstructed to take organized notes; both groups were \ngiven an opportunity to review their notes. On the other \nhand, Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014, Experiment 3) \nshowed that the advantage of longhand note-taking \n(with presumably more generative processing) per-\nsisted when they gave the participants an opportunity \nto review their notes before a test after a 1-week delay. \nThis issue of whether generative note-taking or verba-\ntim note-taking with greater quantity makes for better \nstorage function is an important issue that demands \nfurther research, especially in the context of increas-\ningly popular note-taking on computers. With computer \nnote-taking, students can type more notes than when \nthey write, but their notes are more likely to be verba-\ntim when typing (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014).\nUnlike the marking research, where being able to \nreview the marked information yields minimal benefits, \nbeing able to review notes is a potent addition to the note-\ntaking strategy (Howe, 1970; Kiewra, 1985; Kobayashi, \n2006). Supporting this conclusion, a meta-analysis of 57 \nstudies computed the average effect size of note-taking \nwithout review to be relatively small (Cohen\u2019s d of 0.22 \n(95% confidence interval, or CI = [0.17, 0.27]; Kobayashi, \n2005).

They found that copy-\ning verbatim did not yield any benefits relative to not \ntaking notes at all. However, it is important to note that \nBretzing and Kulhavy did not allow learners to go back \nand review their notes before being tested.\nFinally, note-taking may be less effective for audio-visual \npresentations of content (e.g., lecture with PowerPoint). \nIn his meta-analysis, Kobayashi (2005) found that the \neffect size for note-taking was significantly larger for", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3617, "end_char_idx": 5540, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b23f613-42af-4af4-a75a-0a9f4839616d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b23f613-42af-4af4-a75a-0a9f4839616d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "396", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac8fb492-8d6b-4d0e-9849-506374ea76d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "396", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "7f814ec02dbe4b1fc7b987617ca819208463964d7f6d7092a6740a429f162a7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e1fe6dc-db9d-431d-85c9-d8265524c405", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9da9d5729c83b43aeb418899e202f59e35b17730bf0f58017d0a4943ef994fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "396 Miyatsu et al.\naudio or text presentations than for audio-visual presenta-\ntions. He reasoned that this might be because visual atten-\ntion to handwriting (or typing) movements may be \ninterfering with the visual processing of the presented \ninformation. No study has experimentally manipulated this \nfactor, however, so it is only speculative at the moment. \nNevertheless, it is an important finding that should be given \nfurther consideration, given that most lectures consist pri-\nmarily of audio-visual presentations (e.g., particularly con-\ntexts in which the visual presentation is not just a repetition \nof what the instructor is saying).\nEducational recommendations\nThere are two recommendations that can be drawn \nfrom the literature reviewed above. First, if there is no \ntime to review the notes, students should engage in \ngenerative note-taking strategies such as summarizing \nand outlining. The converse of this recommendation, \nwhich may point to a pitfall of a note-taking strategy, \nis that taking notes by simply transcribing verbatim and \nnot reviewing the notes is unlikely to benefit learning. \nEven worse, shallow processing imposed by the verba-\ntim transcription may actually hinder learning by pre-\nventing the learners from engaging with the material \nmore meaningfully. Second, review the notes. As the \nmeta-analyses on the benefits of note-taking with or \nwithout review showed (Kobayashi, 2005, 2006), the \nbeneficial effects of reviewing notes is substantial\u2014\nprobably greater than the benefits of the act of taking \nnotes. Although the important issues of optimal strate-\ngies (i.e., generative or transcribe as much as possible) \nand the mode of note-taking (i.e., longhand or on com-\nputer) in the context of reviewing remain inconclusive, \nit is clear that reviewing is imperative in using note-\ntaking optimally.\nOutlining\nOutlining, a hierarchical representation of the main \npoints of material to be studied, is a long-standing study \ntechnique endorsed by both educators and students. A \nsurvey of more than 300 teachers in the 1920s found \nthat nearly half of them required their students to pre-\npare an outline while reading texts (Monroe, 1921). A \nmore recent survey in four classes from various disci-\nplines indicated that nearly two thirds (65%) of the \nstudents outlined at some point during the class \n(Walvoord et\u00a0al., 1995). The effectiveness of outlining \nis so widely accepted that the most popular text reading \nand editing programs, such as Microsoft Word and \nAdobe Acrobat Reader, come with a function to edit or \ndisplay the outline of the text. One reason for outlin-\ning\u2019s popularity might be that it offers an opportunity \nfor learners to engage in active learning through iden-\ntification and structured organization of key information \n(Mayer, 2008, Chapter 11). In addition, reading a pro-\nvided outline of a lecture beforehand or in conjunction \nwith the lecture can facilitate students\u2019 organization of \nthe information to be learned and result in better learn-\ning (e.g., Bui & McDaniel, 2015; advance organizers: \nMayer, 2008, Chapter 10).\nThe distinction between learner-generated and \ninstructor (or experimenter)-generated outlines is an \nimportant one when evaluating the research on outlin-\ning. In experiments using learner-generated outlines, \nparticipants construct their own outline from scratch as \nthey learn the material, whereas in experiments with \nexperimenter-generated outlines, learners are given an \noutline prepared by the experimenter to guide their \nstudy.

Next, we review \nstudies on these different types of outlining separately \nto draw out when they are (and are not) effective.\nEffective implementation\nExperimenter-generated outlines benefit students\u2019 \nlearning whether they are given before studying (see \nalso the information below on advance organizers; \nEggen, Kauchak, & Kirk, 1978; Eylon & Reif, 1984; \nGlynn & Di Vesta, 1977; Hartley, 1976) or after studying \nas a review aid (Kiewra, DuBois, Christian, & McShane, \n1988; but see Glynn & Di Vesta, 1977).

Finally, a few stud-\nies have demonstrated the benefits of skeletal outlines \nthroughout an entire semester of a course (Austin, Lee, \nThibeault, Carr, & Bailey, 2002; Cornelius & Owen-\nDeSchryver, 2008).\nOne form of outlining that we have not discussed \nbut that has received substantial attention is advance \norganizers (e.g., Ausubel, 1960, 2012; Chapter 1). An \nadvance organizer is a presentation of the overarching \nidea before learning from a text or a lecture, and it \noften takes the form of an experimenter-generated out-\nline with a pictorial representation of the concept. It \nhas been shown to benefit learning across a variety of \nscientific concepts (e.g., computer science: Mayer, 1975; \nmechanics of radars: Mayer, 1983) and on higher-order \nassessments (e.g., Mayer, 1980, 1983; see also Corkill, \n1992). Because advance organizers include pictorial \nrepresentations (e.g., illustrations, diagrams), teasing \napart the effects of outlining per se is difficult. There-\nfore, we do not include an in depth review of this lit-\nerature (for a review, see Mayer, 2008, Chapter 10; for \na meta-analysis on oral advance organizers, see Preiss \n& Gayle, 2006). Nevertheless, this literature reinforces \nthe effectiveness of presenting an experimenter- \ngenerated outline before the learning of the material.\nIneffective implementation\nLearner-generated outlines, by contrast, show benefits \nonly when participants go through an outline training \nprocess (Barton, 1930; Berkowitz, 1986; Taylor, 1982, \nExperiment 1; Taylor & Beach, 1984; but see Taylor, 1982, \nExperiment 2). Studies with college students (Tuckman, \n1993) and younger students (Eggen et\u00a0al., 1978) in which \nparticipants were simply told to outline as they studied \n(without any prior training) failed to show any benefit \nof outlining relative to unguided note-taking or simply \nreading. Sometimes younger students do not outline \neffectively even with extensive training (Taylor, 1982, \nExperiment 2). What is noteworthy here is that after \nappropriate training (for details, see the next paragraph), \nlearner-generated outlining can enhance younger stu-\ndents\u2019 comprehension (middle and high school students: \nBarton, 1930; 5th graders: Taylor, 1982, Experiment 1; \n7th graders: Taylor & Beach, 1984) using educationally \nauthentic texts (history: Barton, 1930; health and social \nstudies: Taylor, 1982, Experiment 1; Taylor & Beach, \n1984).2\nAlthough the length of the outlining training used in \ndifferent experiments has varied (45 min a week for 6 \nweeks: Berkowitz, 1986; 1 hr a week for 7 weeks: Taylor, \n1982; Taylor & Beach, 1984), a common feature is that \nthe training included regular sessions to practice the \nskill over several weeks. Other important commonalities \namong these successful outlining-training protocols \ninclude an emphasis on identifying the main points \nafter reading through the whole section, identifying the \ntext structure, and retrieving the contents using the \noutline as a cue. Correctly identifying the main points \nof the text is the fundamental component of successful \noutlining. This identification process starts from first \nreading through the entire text (or a section, depending \non the length) before identifying the main points. Some \ntraining programs also emphasized the importance of \nidentifying the text structure (Berkowitz, 1986; Taylor, \n1982; Taylor & Beach, 1984). Correctly identifying how \nthe text is structured not only allows the learner to \nidentify the main points more easily but also gives the \nlearner a better understanding of how the ideas in the \ntext are organized. Finally, successful training also incor-\nporated retrieval practice, which is one of the most \npowerful learning techniques (e.g., Roediger & Karpicke, \n2006a; see also the Using Flash Cards section), using \nthe outline as a cue.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4032, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a83a2f5-702c-4777-9145-f609b22caa97": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a83a2f5-702c-4777-9145-f609b22caa97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "397", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c877517-be72-45a9-ba05-4ad1e41ff889", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "397", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "ca950613990c20ff26fc3fd716fd6b72c1483b9d5f751ac9072bc05435f6e38f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d69e57d3-9f36-46ac-b882-570f2301909e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "397", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "63e3d0c6a06ab726ad92f6ad2b71e0d29a3d3fa53b80b723576a2c2d243111f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Correctly identifying the main points \nof the text is the fundamental component of successful \noutlining.

The extensive training (e.g., 1 hr a week for sev-\neral weeks) and the need for constant feedback during \nthese training sessions are costly but from our perspec-\ntive, assuming that the benefits are relatively long last-\ning, that training expense is relatively minor.\nFinally, the effectiveness of providing an experimenter-\ngenerated outline before reading texts emphasizes the \nimportance of reading the table of contents or any out-\nline before reading, which is often neglected. For exam-\nple, when reading textbooks, students may be tempted \nto skip the table of contents, using it primarily when \nthey need to locate particular topics of interest. How-\never, research reviewed above suggests that reading \nthrough the table of contents and building an under-\nstanding of how the text is organized is likely to improve \ncomprehension and retention.\nUsing Flash Cards\nUsing flash cards is essentially the real-world applica-\ntion of self-testing studies conducted in the laboratory \n(Kornell, 2009; Pyc & Rawson, 2007, 2011; Rawson & \nDunlosky, 2011; Vaughn & Rawson, 2011). Thus, it \nshould be expected that using flash cards is an effective \nstudy strategy, given that self-testing has been shown \nto produce robust benefits on retention (for a review; \nsee Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). However, it is impor-\ntant to note that cognitive psychologists and college \nstudents differ considerably in why they believe flash \ncards are effective. Specifically, cognitive psychologists \nposit that the retrieval component of using flash cards \nis helping students learn and retain the target informa-\ntion. Students, on the other hand, use flash cards \nbecause they believe that it helps them gauge how well \nthey have learned the material (Kornell & Son, 2009; \nWissman et\u00a0al., 2012). Although students commonly \nreport using flash cards as a study strategy, empirical \nresearch on this topic is lacking. To our knowledge, \nonly a handful of studies have investigated the benefits \nof using flash cards (or self-testing). As such, we will \nborrow significantly from the experimenter-guided test-\ning literature to make this section a more informed \nreview. Because testing of associative material is essen-\ntially the laboratory corollary of using flash cards, we \nbelieve that the findings should generalize to self-testing \nwith flash cards in an authentic educational setting. \nThus, the present review makes the assumption that \nstudents are actually engaging in self-testing rather than \njust reading the flash cards.\nEffective implementation\nIf the goal is to retain specific, detailed information, \nusing flash cards is one of the most effective study strate-\ngies. Consequently, much of the research on experimenter-\nguided testing has used associative learning materials, \nsuch as foreign vocabulary (Carrier & Pashler, 1992;  \nKarpicke & Roediger, 2008; Pyc & Rawson, 2011), con-\ncept definitions (Rawson & Dunlosky, 2011), and medical \nterms (Schmidmaier et\u00a0al., 2011), as the study material. \nThe benefits of testing have also been demonstrated in \nmore authentic educational contexts. For example, \nSchmidmaier et\u00a0al.

These results suggest \nthat students should continue to practice recalling the \ntarget information even after they can get it correct the \nfirst time.\nAnother factor that can enhance the benefits of self-\ntesting is the amount of lag or spacing between study-\ning an item.

For instance, Pyc and Rawson \n(2011) had students learn pairs of Swahili and English \nwords that were separated by either 6 or 34 other items, \nand they found that the longer lag condition led to better \nretention (76% vs. 55% for test after a 25-min delay; 30% \nvs. 5% for a test after a 1-week delay). Thus, it is impor-\ntant for students not to just keep drilling the same item; \nrather, they should take a break and come back to that \nitem later on.\nIneffective implementation\nOne potential pitfall associated with using flash cards \nis knowing when to drop a flash card. Specifically, how \ndoes one determine when an item has been learned? \nTheoretically and intuitively speaking, dropping flash \ncards that are well learned from study should allow \nmore study opportunities for yet-to-be-learned flash \ncards and thus result in better overall learning. How-\never, Kornell and Bjork (2008) found that allowing stu-\ndents to self-regulate their own study by dropping flash \ncards (relative to not dropping) had detrimental effects \non learning. Their explanation was that students lacked \nthe requisite metacognitive accuracy to effectively drop \nflash cards from future study. This is not the entire story, \nhowever. Even assuming that metacognitive accuracy \nwas perfect, dropping items from additional testing may \nalso have detrimental effects because the learner loses \nout on additional practice. For instance, Karpicke and \nRoediger (2007) dropped correctly recalled items from \nfurther testing and found that it still had negative con-\nsequences relative to repeated testing. A potential \nexplanation is that dropping correctly recalled items \ndiminished spacing, which has significant benefits for \nretention of information (see Soderstrom, Kerr, & Bjork, \n2016).\nAnother potential limitation of using flash cards is \nthat it is difficult to target higher order information. \nBecause flash cards were developed to learn specific, \ndetailed information, zero investigation has examined \nwhether flash cards can be used to learn complex infor-\nmation that is not simply associative learning.\nA final consideration of using flash cards optimally \nconcerns whether mixing (also referred to as interleav-\ning) flash cards from two different topics is beneficial \nfor long-term retention. Although a good deal of labora-\ntory evidence suggests that mixing is beneficial in cat-\negory and math learning (e.g., Kang & Pashler, 2012; \nKornell & Bjork, 2008; Taylor & Rohrer, 2010; Wahlheim, \nDunlosky, & Jacoby, 2011), the story is less clear in flash \ncard studies. To address this question, Hausman and \nKornell (2014) varied whether learners studied flash \ncards for two different topics (i.e., anatomical definitions \nand Indonesian translations) in a mixed or a separate \ncondition. Their results indicated that mixing flash cards \nfrom two different topics had no influence on long-term \nretention, which suggests that students have much flex-\nibility in how they use flash cards to study for different \nclasses.\nEducational recommendations\nThere are two important points to take away from the \npresent review on how to use flash cards effectively. \nFirst, students should keep studying and testing them-\nselves even after they get an item correct. Doing so \nresults in dual benefits: (a) The additional practice is \ncrucial for strengthening their memory for the target \ninformation, and (b) they will be able to avoid the \npitfall of inaccurate metacognition (i.e., not discriminat-\ning between learned and unlearned information). This \nis contrary to the conventional wisdom that once you \nget an item correct, you should stop studying it. Second, \nstudents should space out their studying of a given flash \ncard. According to Wissman et\u00a0al. (2012), students do \nnot appear to recognize the importance of self-testing \nwith longer lags even though it has been shown empiri-\ncally that spacing out an item between practice attempts \nmakes that item more likely to be recalled in the future.\nGeneral Discussion\nThere has been a growing interest in applying findings \nfrom cognitive science to enhance educational prac-\ntices.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4251, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c85a1cb8-0669-434a-8857-0e99839af577": {"__data__": {"id_": "c85a1cb8-0669-434a-8857-0e99839af577", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "399", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d52539d-fd9e-4b14-975a-84d34f887086", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "399", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "e0e26a149918be6834e99dab8f8ebcd77fe93b57a8059ba8dbfba30458e8cd94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02f9b069-4a66-4bef-9987-115aeaa73585", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "399", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "1ea9c08d92f03bad6e7029a5420fd91c809b25037446dfbaef008224e2ac0a2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Doing so \nresults in dual benefits: (a) The additional practice is \ncrucial for strengthening their memory for the target \ninformation, and (b) they will be able to avoid the \npitfall of inaccurate metacognition (i.e., not discriminat-\ning between learned and unlearned information).

Recent reviews strongly suggest that there are \npotent study strategies that foster effective learning \n(Bjork, Dunlosky, & Kornell, 2013; Dunlosky et\u00a0al., \n2013; Fiorella & Mayer, 2015; Roediger & Pyc, 2012). \nYet students\u2019 study-strategy choices are largely driven \nby their perceived understanding at the moment of \nstudying (Soderstrom & Bjork, 2015), and it appears \nthat students rarely use these strategies that truly pro-\nmote learning. Accordingly, in the present review, using \nexisting empirical evidence from the cognitive and edu-\ncational literatures, we explored whether students\u2019 pre-\nferred study strategies might have merit. Given students\u2019 \nstrong preferences in using these strategies anyway, \nilluminating when they do benefit learning\u2014and when \nthey do not\u2014may at least guide students to use the \nstrategies optimally. In Table 2, we summarize the main \noutcomes of our review of five popular study strategies \n(rereading, highlighting, note-taking, underlining, and \nusing flash cards) in terms of (a) common pitfalls, (b) \ntips for optimal implementation, and (c) effectiveness \nfor different test types.\nA few common themes have emerged about how to \nappropriately leverage these five strategies to produce", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3374, "end_char_idx": 5483, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b53bbb2-71b3-4642-b904-1e03b2257aba": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b53bbb2-71b3-4642-b904-1e03b2257aba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "400", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a328a27e-9855-4949-95f4-42d7afecdc41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "400", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "c8f0bb213fc4d7734824742efb0d99e45f3ac1cb1406056f83a6c21621668a2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "67cf5763-f171-44f8-856b-aa6440f9abe4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a7b0b7093c709e16d74b35ae7a3c731a2a10a6cb2c41ed373998664af48641e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "400 Miyatsu et al.\noptimal memory and comprehension performance. One \nclear conclusion from our review is that students, when \nleft to their own devices, do not use these popular \nstrategies very effectively. Students are often unaware \nof the pitfalls associated with these strategies, including \nmistaking fluency for learning when rereading, high-\nlighting too much, copying notes verbatim, and prema-\nturely dropping flash cards from further study. However, \nthese pitfalls can be overcome once students are made \naware of them and are provided with explicit instruc-\ntions to avoid them.\nAside from avoiding the pitfalls listed in Table 2, our \nreview suggests that there are potent ways to augment \nthese popular study strategies, including incorporating \ncognitive-psychologist-endorsed strategies (e.g., retrieval \npractice, distributed practice), hosting training, and pro-\nviding instructor assistance.\nFirst, in some of our recommendations, we suggested \nthe incorporation of study strategies that are strongly \nendorsed by cognitive psychologists but rarely used by \nstudents. One might wonder what is new about these \nrecommendations. For instance, in the case of reread-\ning, some might argue that recommending spacing the \nreadings or self-testing between readings is the same \nas simply recommending distributed practice or retrieval \npractice (which may not be fruitful in changing stu-\ndents\u2019 study behavior). However, our recommendations \nin this regard are different from the previous recommen-\ndations because they align with the principle that new \nbehaviors are attained most efficiently when they are \nincorporated into preexisting behaviors. This principle is \nwell established in other fields, such as exercise interven-\ntion (e.g., Lutes et\u00a0al., 2012), and we think that it is likely \nto also have bearing on study-strategy intervention. Spe-\ncifically, students might not know how exactly to imple-\nment retrieval practice effectively, so identifying novel \noccasions and implementing it properly takes effort, \nthus potentially diminishing the likelihood that students \nwill actually implement retrieval practice. On the con-\ntrary, students already have a strong tendency to reread, \nso having them take a moment to try to retrieve what \nthe read contents were before rereading would better \nalign with students\u2019 established study habits and, \naccordingly, might be more fruitful in making a change. \nIn this sense, some of our recommendations are \nintended not only to make students\u2019 preferred study \nstrategies more effective, but also to use these habitual \nstrategies as vehicles to introduce more effective but \nrarely practiced strategies into students\u2019 routines.\nSecond, training students on how to use the study \nstrategies can also produce more robust benefits on \nlearning outcomes. Research has demonstrated that \nmarking yields more robust benefits after learners have \nbeen trained on effective marking strategies (Amer, 1994; \nDumke & Sch\u00e4fer, 1986; Leutner et\u00a0al., 2007; Schnell & \nRocchio, 1978) and learner-generated outlining is espe-\ncially effective when participants receive training on how \nto outline (Barton, 1930; Berkowitz, 1986; Taylor, 1982, \nExperiment 1; Taylor & Beach, 1984). Thus, it is critical \nthat students receive some training on how to effectively \nuse these study strategies to reap the full benefits. Fur-\nther, because these training programs can benefit even \nTable 2.

For instance, it has been found that students of \nall ages can benefit from outlining when provided with \na skeletal outline, whereas many students fail to benefit \nfrom outlining from scratch (see the Outlining section). \nA simple and effective solution would be for instructors \nto provide their students with a skeletal outline before \nthe lecture starts. Another instance in which instructors \ncan assist students is by quizzing them on a given topic \non various occasions, which would indirectly require \nstudents to engage in spaced review (e.g., rereading or \nflash cards). Instructors may even incentivize these effec-\ntive implementations by awarding a small portion of the \ncourse grade to students for turning in their completed \noutlines or performing well on the quizzes.\nIndividual differences\nAlthough our review thus far has focused on the gen-\neral effectiveness of study strategies for all learners, it \nwould be a disservice not to briefly discuss how indi-\nvidual differences may moderate the effectiveness of \nthese study strategies. Research on this issue is sorely \nlacking, but for two of the strategies, there has been \npreliminary research that is worth mentioning. First, \nrereading seems to be a much more useful study strat-\negy for good comprehenders (as indexed by the Multi-\nMedia Comprehension Battery; Gernsbacher, Varner, & \nFaust, 1990) than for poor comprehenders (Martin, \nNguyen, & McDaniel, 2016). In particular, Martin et\u00a0al. \nfound that good comprehenders demonstrated superior \nmetacognitive control\u2014the ability to effectively guide \ntheir restudy opportunity. Specifically, good compre-\nhenders were more likely than poor comprehenders to \nengage in a discrepancy-reduction strategy (i.e., allo-\ncate more study time for information identified as less \nwell learned than information identified as well learned; \ncf. Thiede & Dunlosky, 1999) during a second reading. \nThese results suggest that students who are already \ngood comprehenders can benefit from a variety of \nstudy strategies, even those strategies that provide little \nguidance. On the other hand, poor comprehenders \nmight benefit more from study strategies that provide \nthem with specific instructions on how to study.\nSecond, the benefits of note-taking may be moder -\nated by working memory ability. In particular, learners \nwith low working memory are better off transcribing \nthan synthesizing lecture notes (Bui & Myerson, 2014). \nA plausible explanation is that learners with low work-\ning memory are unable to hold in mind and manipulate \ndifferent pieces of information while initially recording \nnotes. By contrast, learners with high working memory, \nwho have the capacity to hold and manipulate informa-\ntion while recording notes, should attempt to organize \nand synthesize the lecture content during note-taking \nto develop a deeper understanding of the content.\nFuture research on individual differences in the \neffectiveness of study strategies may benefit from con-\nsidering two additional core skills, metacognition and \norganization, that we believe underlie students\u2019 ability \nto use these popular study strategies efficaciously. \nMetacognition plays a vital role in mediating successful \nlearning, especially in the cases of rereading and using \nflash cards, during which learners need to be cognizant \nof what they know and do not know to determine what \nto focus on during a second reading or deciding when \nto drop a flash card from further studying. Organization, \nwhich is the ability to understand the relationship \nbetween key points and grasp what is important, plays \nan important role in identifying important information \nto mark or constructing a coherent outline structure.\nFuture directions\nOne fruitful avenue for future research would be to \ninvestigate the benefits of combining study strategies. \nMuch of the prior research has investigated various study \nstrategies in isolation and characterized their efficacy \nand mechanisms that way.

However, combining suitable \nstudy strategies can be more effective and efficient than \nusing a single strategy. Basic research on this issue is in \nits infancy, and only a handful of potential potent com-\nbinations are being investigated (retrieval practice and \nthe keyword mnemonic: Miyatsu & McDaniel, 2018; \nretrieval practice and rereading: Nguyen & McDaniel, \n2016; marking and massing/spacing: Yue et\u00a0al., 2015; see \nalso Intelligent Tutoring of the Structure Strategy3: for \napplied research taking this approach, see Meyer et\u00a0al., \n2002; Meyer & Wijekumar, 2017; Meyer, Wijekumar, & \nLin, 2011; Wijekumar et\u00a0al., 2014).

As mentioned in the note-taking section, \nan emergent question is whether students should take \nnotes by writing and engage in generative strategies or \nby typing and transcribing as many notes as possible. \nDoes the editing allowed by computers make outlining \non computers better than hand-written outlines? There \nare various smartphone applications that allow students \nto easily copy and paste information to create flash \ncards or even websites that provide premade flash \ncards. Is studying with these new types of flash cards \nas effective as studying with flash cards that are made \nby learners themselves?\nFinally, a venerable idea that merits revisiting is the \nconcept of generative learning and how it contributes \nto the observed benefit of each strategy. As touched \nupon in the previous sections, many study strategies \nhave generation and utilization components (e.g., the \nencoding and storage function of note-taking). Isolating \nthe benefits of these components will provide impor-\ntant insights on optimal implementation. For instance, \nthe existing research on flash cards has focused primar-\nily on the use component. Thus, it is unknown whether \ngeneration of flash cards (by students) has any unique \nbenefits to learning aside from simply using the flash \ncards. Likewise, would instructor-provided notes be \nmore beneficial than student-generated notes?\nConcluding comments\nIt is clear that students have strong study-strategy pref-\nerences that do not align with the strategies being \nadvocated by cognitive psychologists (Dunlosky et\u00a0al., \n2013; Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012; Karpicke et\u00a0al., 2009; \nKornell & Bjork, 2007; Wissman et\u00a0al., 2012; Yan et\u00a0al., \n2014). Accordingly, a productive approach might be to \nassist students with optimizing the strategies that they \nprefer. In addition, we suggest using these popular \nstudy strategies as vehicles to introduce the strategies \nendorsed by cognitive psychologists into students\u2019 \nstudy routines. Our review serves as a starting point \nfor the approach of identifying and augmenting strate-\ngies that students already use. It is our hope that stu-\ndents use these assessments of their favorite study \nstrategies to help them study more effectively, that \ninstructors become aware of opportunities to actively \nassist students\u2019 optimal implementation of these strate-\ngies, and that psychologists become interested in con-\nducting research on exploring effective augmentations \nto these strategies.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared that there were no conflicts of interest with \nrespect to the authorship or the publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. Aside from spaced study, another way to augment reread-\ning might be to encourage high-level processing (i.e., situation-\nmodel processing; Johnson-Laird, 1983; Kintsch, 1988; see also \nBos, De Koning, Wassenburg, & van der Schoot, 2016) during \nthe second reading. One way to stimulate such processing is to \nencourage the reader to explicitly consider the state of his or \nher situation model by making judgments of inferencing (JOIs; \ni.e., learners judge how likely they would be able to apply \nthe core knowledge they just learned in the future) before the \nsecond reading, which can enhance inference and problem-\nsolving performance relative to a second reading with no JOIs \n(e.g., Nguyen & McDaniel, 2016, in which JOIs followed a \nretrieval practice phase before a second reading).\n2. It bears mention that outlining can be used for writing rather \nthan for improving comprehension of text or lecture material. \nLearner-generated outlining without prior training facilitates \nessay writing by improving the structure of the written product \nand it appears to reduce mental effort (De Smet, Brand-Gruwel, \nLeijten, & Kirschner, 2014; De Smet, Broekkamp, Brand-Gruwel, \n& Kirschner, 2011; Kellogg, 1990; but see De Smet, Brand-\nGruwel, Broekkamp, & Kirschner, 2012).\n3.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3962, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9328a8b4-7357-4279-93dc-6684ed836dc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9328a8b4-7357-4279-93dc-6684ed836dc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "402", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f8b26cb4-06ca-4f37-9cb0-77c5d3ddb9c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "402", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "79314af2e15fca43ce3cd36fe1f5bbd619261de80512281dcb5d63659740d754", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa909777-e35d-4c78-a093-a4c4cf8b0f4f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "402", "file_name": "1745691617710510.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1745691617710510.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 212625, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "d9a1a8e890131676bab935d1893e0b990bb497c668b5c83d320bc41dfee81436", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "2.

As the name suggests, students assume increased\nautonomy and responsibility for their own learning. Often, students identify individual\nlearning goals to pursue external goals. Students build on unique background knowledge\nand experiences and further explore, select, and use tools and resources. Students navigate\nunspeci\ufb01ed paths, monitor progress, and develop personal strategies. Whether an indi-\nvidual or a group project, students communicate and consult with others (Bransford et al.\n2000; Brush and Saye 2000; Hanna\ufb01n et al. 2014).\nWe argued that SCL is a complex learning process that students must be thoroughly\nsupported in the motivational, cognitive, and social aspects. A common but poorly sup-\nported SCL assumption is that students will perform independently without external\nguidance (Hanna\ufb01n et al.2014). Instead, students should be scaffolded through the process\nfrom owning the project, researching for the project, and sharing the project outcomes.\nAccording to McCombs and Whisler (1997), learner-centered approaches focused on how\nto support unique individuality of varying interests, needs, capacities, backgrounds, and\nperspectives.\nIn pursuit of a SCL framework, nearly two decades ago, Grabinger and Dunlap ( 1995)\npromoted the Rich Environments for Active Learning (REAL) model in which students\nassumed increased ownership, engaged in multiple higher-order thinking activities, and\narticulated and present an artifact. More recently, Casey (2013) presented a SCL frame-\nwork that focused on the social aspect of SCL capitalizing active learning and peer support\nvia social media. Keller\u2019s ARCS model (Keller1987) provided a motivational design\napproach to instruction to systemically enhance attention, relevance, con\ufb01dence, and sat-\nisfaction. Previous design frameworks for learning and instruction have not adequately\nembodied the intersections of the key motivational, cognitive, social, and affective con-\nstructs afforded by emerging technologies. Particularly, existing frameworks typically\nfailed to scaffold student autonomy.\nWe propose an alternative SCL design framework that encompasses motivational,\ncognitive, social, and affective aspects of learning. We identify key constructs of SCL\nengagement as (a) autonomy from Self-Determination Theory (Ryan and Deci2000),\n(b) scaffolding from constructivism (Vygotsky 1978), and (c) authentic audience from\nConstructionism (Harel and Papert 1991). We examine previous research on autonomy,\nscaffolding, and audience and apply efforts to promote enhanced engagement by adapting\nthese principles in the Own it, Learn it, and Share it (OLSit) framework. As we support\nstudents to be fully engaged, we acknowledge and maximize the autonomy of students\nwhile providing appropriate scaffolding and capitalizing on emerging Web 2.0\ntechnologies.\nThis paper aims to provide a conceptual framework and practical guidelines to the\nresearchers and practitioners who seek to enhance student engagement with SCL. We \ufb01rst\nreview chronological emergence of SCL and examine the characteristics of SCL. Then, we\nexamine Self-Determination Theory and constructivist-and constructionist-inspired epis-\ntemologies and key constructs. Furthermore, we present the OLSit model and research-\nbased design guidelines to support instructors\u2019 and students\u2019 efforts to create autonomous\nE. Lee, M. J.

We conclude by discussing remaining questions and needs for future research.\nEmergence and characteristics of student-centered learning\nExpectations of student engagement vary in the industrial age and the emerging infor-\nmation society. In the industrial age, behavioral and cognitivist-inspired approaches\nde\ufb01ned performance requirements across education and workforce populations. Tradi-\ntionally, curriculum and teaching methods were characterized as emphasizing compliant\nunderstanding (McCaslin and Good1992), expecting and receiving explicit directions from\ninstructors, and documenting concordance with external expectations. In externally\ndirected learning, many consider student engagement to be needlessly passive, focusing on\nnarrowly prescribed outcomes over depth of individual understanding or independent\nlearning (Maclellan and Soden2003).\nIn contrast, The current and approaching information society demands \ufb02exible, adaptive\nskills and abilities. We now expect the workforce to reason dynamically and critically,\nmake informed decisions, solve unknown problems, and work collaboratively to address\nunanticipated priorities (ISTE2015). We cannot be certain which challenges will emerge\nand under what circumstances the workforce will need to adapt. It is therefore critical that\nformal educational systems prepare students to negotiate and resolve future uncertainties.\nHence, SCL has been touted as a needed alternative to traditional, teacher-centered\ninstruction to develop the \ufb02exible, adaptive skills essential in the 21st century workforce\n(Clinton and Rieber2010; Land et al. 2012).\nSince expectations of student engagement are different in age and society, researchers\nsuggest different approaches to learning. Behaviorists such as Thorndike and Skinner\nadvocated and applied human learning in the form of stimuli-response-reinforcement\nsystems (Driscoll 2000). As represented in \u2018\u2018cats in puzzle boxes,\u2019\u2019 when desired responses\nwere rewarded, learned behaviors were reinforced. Conversely, when responses were not\nrewarded or punished, undesired responses extinguished (Thorndike1911). Learning from\nthe objectivist epistemology practiced in the form of receiving, storing, and recalling\ninformation given from external sources (e.g., instructors) (Jonassen1991).\nFrom a different perspective of constructivist epistemology, students do not passively\nreceive and process information. Rather, they actively construct knowledge and skills and\nreorganize their understanding via interactions with their environment as well as other\nencounters and past experiences (Jonassen1991). Historically, Dewey ( 1916) described\nlearning as \u2018\u2018that reconstruction or reorganization of experience which adds to the meaning\nof experience, and which increases ability to direct the course of subsequent experience\u2019\u2019\n(p. 76). Subsequently, Dewey (1938) advocated the need for providing students with\nopportunities to test hypotheses and explore issues more critically. Piaget\u2019s ( 1954) cog-\nnitive approaches to education highlighted person-environment interaction. A. Aebli\nenunciated Piaget\u2019s theory in the form of discovery learning: \u2018\u2018creating a free, problem-\nsolving situation whereby the learner selects a task and is free to do what he (or she) likes\nto complete it. The teacher may intervene by asking appropriate questions so the student\ncan develop hypotheses and test them\u2019\u2019 (as cited in Saettler1990. p. 329). Vygotsky ( 1978)\ndiscussed that learning was a social process in which students explored concepts that were\nof interest to them, and negotiated the meaning of those concepts with others.\nA design framework for enhancing engagement \u2026\n123", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3764, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab81cd9b-c5a5-440a-9edc-35310100fff3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab81cd9b-c5a5-440a-9edc-35310100fff3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1131080, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e1c59ac-171f-41c9-8304-5039b8a73bfd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1131080, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "98d09acde8b923686f17219a51ab8e4ca5b3e6bce8386fb7467c66699a6c4504", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "These constructivist epistemologies have been rei\ufb01ed as SCL. Glasgow ( 1997)\ndescribed SCL as in which: \u2018\u2018students learn to decide what they need to know to \ufb01nd\nsuccess within the class and educational format. Although the teacher may have consid-\nerable responsibility in facilitating investigative and discovery activities, it is expected that\nthe student will gradually take responsibility for their own learning (p. 34).\u2019\u2019 Brush and\nSaye (2000) noted that SCL is designed for students to assume a more active role in their\nlearning by assuming responsibilities to organize, analyze, and synthesize rather than\nmerely acquired content from the teacher. Students, in effect, are empowered to re\ufb01ne their\nlearning processes with support from teachers and peers (Estes 2004).\nSCL has been described using various names that follow problem-based learning\n(Barrows 1980), project-based learning (Blumenfeld et al. 1991), case-based learning\n(Christensen 1987), and inquiry learning (Kuhn et al. 2000). In a problem-based learning\napproach, students work collaboratively in a group to identify what and how to learn in\norder to solve a problem; students learn in a self-directed manner, devise and test a\nplausible solution, and re\ufb02ect on what they have learned and the effectiveness of their\nsolution (Hmelo-Silver2004). Typically in project-based learning, students are engaged in\na challenging, complex project that is similar to those they might encounter in the real\nworld (Brush and Saye2000). In a case-based approach, students review a realistic sce-\nnario that represents the problem to solve, discuss it with peers, evaluate the proposed\nsolutions, and re\ufb02ect on what is learned and what needs to be learned (Flynn and Klein\n2001). Fundamentally, therefore, students process, interpret, and re\ufb01ne meaning and\nunderstanding based on individual experiences.\nInstruction vs. learning environment\nSCL highlights the importance of the organic learning environments over traditional\ninstruction. Table 1 contrasts traditional direct instruction with SCL approaches.\nAs contrasted in Table 1, SCL is neither rigidly prescribed nor strictly externally\nstructured. Learning environments focus on knowledge acquisition, individual\u2019s reasoning\nand understanding of key concepts, or different combinations. The importance of under-\nstanding and reasoning resides within the individual who may address externally-required\nTable 1 Comparison between directed instruction and student-centered learning\nDirected instruction Student-centered learning\nTheoretical\nframework\nObjectivism Constructivism\nNature of learning Students process speci\ufb01ed\ncontent\nStudents construct knowledge by exploring and\nanalyzing\nMethods Directed learning Scaffolded learning\nContent Well-de\ufb01ned Ill-de\ufb01ned\nLearning goals De\ufb01ned by curriculum or\nteacher\nNegotiated and endorsed by students\nStudent\u2019s roles Knowledge receiver Knowledge generator and evaluator\nTeacher\u2019s roles Knowledge transmitter Facilitator, scaffolding provider\nLocus of control External Internal\nAdapted from Jonassen ( 1991)\nE.

In effect, students determine\nthe means to pursue external as well as individual learning goals, including making\ndecisions about how, when, and whether to proceed based on emergent understanding\n(Hanna\ufb01n et al.2014). In contrast, during direct instruction, designers and instructors\nprescribe paths to follow (Merrill 2002). They establish instructional objectives, select\nresources, provide the context, organize the content, and specify and assess canonical\nunderstanding based on external requirements.\nSCL, therefore, requires a paradigm shift for both students and instructors\u2019 roles during\nlearning. Students\u2019 roles transform from recipient of information to owners of learning\ngoals, decisions, and actions. Consequently, instructors need to learn how to relinquish\ncontrol and support students to become the owner of their learning. Both students and\ninstructors must be supported to realize this transformation. Students may be ill-prepared to\nassume greater autonomy for their learning: \u2018\u2018accustomed to more passive roles in the\ncollege lecture hall may initially resist the active requirements of constructivist pedagogy\u2019 \u2019\n(Reeves2006, p. 304). College students who have bene\ufb01ted from producing externally-\nbased outcomes via didactic instruction often encounter dif\ufb01culty when teaching and\nlearning approaches assume or require greater individual mediation (Kember2001).\nLikewise, instructors may question the value or effectiveness of student-centered ped-\nagogical approaches (Kember 1997) or lack strategies to engage students in self-directed\nlearning (Blumberg 2009). Classroom methods, in turn, in\ufb02uence students\u2019 expectations\nand learning strategies as well as outcomes (Kember and Gow 1994) and epistemologies\n(Sheppard and Gilbert 1991). Reconciliation of alternative roles is \u2018\u2018teachable and learn-\nable\u2019\u2019 but requires the ability and willingness to identify differences between instructor and\nstudent epistemological beliefs about teaching and learning and \u2018\u2018willingness to adapt\nstrategies accordingly\u2019\u2019 (Song et al.2007, p. 35).\nThe debate\nContemporary scholars have disputed the effectiveness of these \u2018\u2018discovery\u2019\u2019 approaches to\nlearning. Mayer ( 2004) reviewed a half-decade of past research and reported consistent\nevidence in favor of fully-guided direct instruction as opposed to \u2018\u2018pure discovery learn-\ning.\u2019\u2019 Kirschner et al. (2006) analyzed inquiry-based learning research in K-12 mathe-\nmatics and science education and problem-based learning in medical education and\nconcluded that these \u2018\u2018minimally guided\u2019\u2019 approaches are not compatible with human\ncognitive architecture and less effective and inef\ufb01cient than instruction that is designed\nwith explicit cognitive guidance (Kirschner et al.2006). Sweller ( 2009) argued that the\nskills needed for discovery, problem-based, inquiry-based learning evolve immaturely and\nmust be explicitly taught. In effect, Clark argued that maximum guidance is effective for\nall types of learning regardless of its goals and context (Clark and Hanna\ufb01n2011).\nContrastingly, proponents of constructivist learning responded that problem-based\nlearning was designed with \ufb02exible adaption of guidance and management of cognitive\nload and was compatible with human cognitive structure (Hmelo-Silver et al. 2007).\nSchmidt et al. ( 2007) added that constructivist learning approaches are not minimally\nguided; rather, they provide extensive scaffolding and guidance to facilitate student\nlearning. Additionally, de Jong (2010) proposed that existing research on cognitive load\nneeded to be extended to explore approaches to help learners manage cognitive load during\nSCL.\nFurthermore, from the instructional design perspectives, constructivist approaches have\nbeen criticized to be ineffective to support externally de\ufb01ned objectives with ordered paths\nA design framework for enhancing engagement \u2026\n123", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3930, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b0b5939-1f17-4675-84f3-5a13c9aab05b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b0b5939-1f17-4675-84f3-5a13c9aab05b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1131080, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b268bdd6-1896-4785-a0e6-62f16777f118", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1131080, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "5bb91c71aa718de6e087edc530cd96dddcc51074838a7ff206ad514e8b000ce7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(Dick 1992; Merrill 1991).

Hanna\ufb01n noted that \u2018\u2018optimally guided\nlearning,\u2019\u2019 not fully-guided direct instruction, employs an adaptive approach to guidance to\naccommodate differences in individual needs as some learning situations and performance\nrequirements are dif\ufb01cult or impossible to identify explicitly in advance (Clark and\nHanna\ufb01n 2011).\nThe emergence and characteristics of SCL can be further understood by its theories.\nConstructs of constructivist learning have been studied. However, the design implications\nfor how to facilitate SCL in the umbrella of constructivist, constructionist, and Self-\ndetermination theory collectively are new. Therefore, we review literature derived from\nSelf-determination theory and constructivist-and constructionist-inspired epistemologies\nand examine the synthesized effects of the key engagement constructs from each theory.\nThen, we present the new design framework and research-based design guidelines for the\nimplementation of the framework.\nTheoretical framework\nSCL engagement is supported by theories that encompass motivational, cognitive, social,\nand affective aspects of learning. Self-determination theory provides explanations about\nhow autonomy plays a key role as a motivational factor in SCL. Constructivism offers an\nunderpinning epistemology about how learners negotiate their learning to construct\nmeaning, particularly with regard to the role of scaffolding to facilitate learning. Con-\nstructionists note that students invest affectively in personally meaningful projects that\ninvolve design, development, and presentation of artifacts relevant for authentic audiences.\nIn the following section, we describe their underlying epistemologies and associated\nassumptions as well as their implications for autonomy, scaffolding, and authentic audi-\nences in the design of SCL.\nSelf-determination theory\nSelf-determination theory (SDT) highlights autonomy, competence, and relatedness as\nbasic human needs to in\ufb02uence high quality motivation (Ryan and Deci2000). According\nto SDT, behaviors vary in relation to the degree to which they are mediated autonomously\nversus externally. Motivation ranges from controlled, extrinsic motivation through\nincreasingly autonomous level to intrinsic motivation (Ryan and Deci 2000). Ryan and\nDeci further note that intrinsic motivation, the most autonomous form, is directly associ-\nated with individual satisfaction and autonomy. Autonomous behaviors emanate from\none\u2019s integrated sense of self, are experienced as volitional, and re\ufb02ect interest or personal\nimportance (Deci and Ryan2000).\nSDT provides a key frame to understanding the in\ufb02uence of autonomy during learning.\nRyan and Deci ( 2000) argued that intrinsically motivated individuals strive to extend their\nability and enjoy doing the activity itself. Intrinsically motivated activities include those\nthat individuals \ufb01nd interesting and would pursue even in the absence of externally\nimposed pressure (Ryan and Deci2000).

Intrinsically\nmotivated, autonomous behaviors help to engage students in deep, individual, meaningful\nprocessing. Students who pursue intrinsic goals tend to engage their learning tasks more\nactively than those who pursue primarily external af\ufb01rmation, recognition by instructors, or\navoidance of negative consequences (Meece et al.1988).\nIn contrast, when extrinsically motivated, individuals act in accordance with external\nrequirements rather than the individual\u2019s perceived value of learning (Deci and Ryan\n2000). Extrinsically-motivated performance goals emphasize demonstrated competence in\nde\ufb01ned outcomes. External forces may confound relationships between individual student\nneeds and their outcomes, particularly when learning tasks involve \ufb02exible, heuristic,\ncreative, or autonomous motivation for successful performance (Deci et al.1999). How-\never, distinctions between autonomous and controlled motivation do not adequately\naccount for the complexities and intricacies of academic motivation (Alexander1997).\nInteractions between autonomous and controlled motivation in\ufb02uence students\u2019 learning\nand performance in SCL.\nIn effect, SDT suggests that individual autonomy enhances volition, motivation, and\nengagement and enhances performance, persistence, and creativity (Deci and Ryan 2000).\nWhen students solve complex problems that require creativity and \ufb02exibility, intrinsic\nmotivation and combined strategies tends to enhance performance more than externally-\nbased performance goals alone (Deci and Ryan 2000). When students make autonomous\ndecisions, they assume greater responsibility for directing their learning, become more\npersonally engaged, and deepen their understanding (Ryan and Deci2000). Accordingly,\nSCL promote opportunities to cultivate individual responsibility for engaging learning\nopportunities, which enhances academic performance as well as student autonomy.\nConstructivism\nConstructivism is not a single, uni\ufb01ed theory; rather, constructivism represents an epis-\ntemological perspective as to the nature and evolution of individual understanding. Schunk\n(1991) explains, \u2018\u2018constructivism does not propound that learning principles exist and are\nto be discovered and tested, but rather learners create their own learning\u2019 \u2019 (p. 236). Despite\nongoing debates related to ontological assumptions and nomenclature, constructivism\nprovides assumptions underlying SCL (Sharma et al.2008).\nConstructivist learning involves iterative processes of discovery as students use their\nown mind to obtain knowledge for themselves and \u2018\u2018rearranging or transforming evidence\u2019\u2019\nto assemble \u2018\u2018additional new insights\u2019\u2019 (Bruner1961, p. 22). Constructivism variants\ncommonly suggest that learner, context, and understanding are connected and interde-\npendent (Gauvain2001; Lave 1988; Rogoff 1990). Further, social constructivism suggests\nthat students interact reciprocally with peers and more knowledgeable others to support\nricher understanding than is possible individually (Vygotsky1978).\nDuring SCL, students experience diverse models and feedback on their actions, which\nsubsequently promote interaction between the student and others. Students communicate\ntheir ideas and make their thoughts explicit; they examine both their own perceptions and\nothers\u2019 views and react accordingly. Thus SCL activities would engage students in a\nchallenging, real-life task, with technology as a tool for learning, communication, and\ncollaboration. These activities would provide students with opportunities to view problems\nfrom a variety of perspectives, allow students to collaborate and negotiate solutions to\nproblems, and test those solutions within a real-world context (Bransford et al.2000;\nHanna\ufb01n et al. 1999).\nA design framework for enhancing engagement \u2026\n123", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3862, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d5920b6-f4ad-4526-8ef8-44cc087a8943": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d5920b6-f4ad-4526-8ef8-44cc087a8943", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1131080, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b28d9298-0376-435f-8c5b-402417e2547b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1131080, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "bf9e75075af64a35872eb36055f4645fa2a5845180615c0fe356f42f82c9b343", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Constructionism\nConstructionism is similar to constructivism in that students actively \u2018\u2018construct\u2019\u2019 rather\nthan simply receive, store, and retrieve knowledge. Bruner\u2019s early emphasis on learning by\ndiscovery was subsequently re\ufb01ned and extended to learning by negotiating and sharing\n(Bruner1986). Bruner ( 1986) characterized learning as \u2018\u2018a communal activity, a sharing of\nthe culture\u2019\u2019 (p. 127). Students individually internalize knowledge within communities that\ninclude others who share their sense of belonging to a culture (Bruner1986).\nHowever, constructionism differs from constructivism as constructionism highlights\nthe hands-on construction of physical artifacts that communicate one\u2019s understanding\n(Ackermann2001). Extended from Piaget\u2019s constructivism, which viewed learning as\nthe process whereby students construct their own unique systems of understanding,\nPapert focused on projecting one\u2019s understanding in a public entity (Harel and Papert\n1991).\nConstructionists produce external and shareable artifacts, re\ufb02ecting the belief that\n\u2018\u2018constructivist processes are more evident when students collaborate to produce and share\nrepresentations of their understanding of the world\u2019\u2019 (Jonassen et al.1996, p. 94). Students\nbecome designers whose artifacts re\ufb02ect complex cognitive negotiations with external\nconstraints. Activities such as making, building, programming, teaching, and consulting\nprovide rich contexts for learning; products from these construction activities re\ufb02ect and\nembody student learning (Harel and Papert1991). Failure, re\ufb02ection, and iterative revi-\nsions re\ufb01ne understanding of concepts and associated skills and practices (Kolodner et al.\n2003).\nConstructionists also note that learning occurs both during the design process as well as\nthrough sharing products. Constructionist learning environments create a culture and\ncommunity as students share one another\u2019s creations and gain a deeper understanding of\nother people\u2019s perspectives about the product and ideas related to the product (Evard\n1996). Environments promote learning by doing as well as learning by thinking and\ndiscussing what you do (Kafai and Resnick 1996). Products require students to represent\ntheir thinking explicitly.\nFinally, constructionists regard affect as critical for learning, whereas constructivists\nfocus principally on cognitive development (Kafai and Resnick 1996). Constructionists\nsuggest that students become intellectually engaged when they work on personally\nmeaningful activities and projects and thus become personally invested. This enthusiasm\nin\ufb02uences both students\u2019 attitudes toward the subject matter as well as their performance\n(Harel and Papert1991). Students become cognitively and emotionally engaged as they\nemploy resources in a social context and design and re\ufb01ne both their understanding and\nartifact (Price and Marshall2013).\nAccording to constructionist, learning is an iterative process in which students \u2018\u2018invent\nfor themselves the tools and mediations that best support the exploration of what they most\ncare about\u2019\u2019 (Ackermann2001, p. 4). Accordingly, a student\u2019s responsibility for individual\nunderstanding increases as associated ownership of both learning processes and products\nincrease (Grabinger and Dunlap1995). Thus, the learning environment should support\nindividual efforts as students construct personal meaning through artifact development\n(Wilson 1996).

While existing literature has pre-\nsented the effects of each key construct in an isolated manner, no previous research has\nsynthesized the effects of the three constructs combined for the purpose of enhancing\nengagement in SCL. Table2 summarizes the contributions of the key constructs to\nlearning and the evidence of its in\ufb02uence in student engagement from previous research.\nAutonomy\nWe adapted Deci and Ryan\u2019s study ( 2000) to de\ufb01ne autonomy as one\u2019s self-endorsed will\nto make one\u2019s own decisions and take voluntary actions. Autonomy is considered an\nimportant factor across all facets of human living, including educational settings as well as\nworkplaces, health, sports, and leisure. Autonomy fosters affective bene\ufb01ts, such as\nengagement, satisfaction, happiness, and wellbeing. When individuals perceive autonomy,\nthey believe their action supports their own will, choices, and self-determination (Ryan and\nDeci2006).\nAutonomy has been associated with locus of control by personality theorists (e.g.,\nRotter 1966). When individuals perceive internal control, they believe they control events\nthat affect their lives; the outcomes of their actions result from their own decisions and\nabilities. In contrast, when control is perceived as externally regulated, individuals believe\nthey have limited in\ufb02uence on outcomes. They perceive future success or failure depends\non external circumstances beyond their control, such as task- dif\ufb01culty or luck (Rotter\n1975). Rather than only internal or external perceived control, individuals may perceive\ncombinations of control, referred to as Bi-locals. Bi-locals may take personal responsibility\nfor their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining susceptive to cooperating\nwith external resources (Palenzuela1984). The perceived locus of control may well explain\ndifferent psychological in\ufb02uences of autonomy in educational settings.\nTo imply in the SCL framework, autonomy is important to ensure that students own\ntheir learning processes. Students mediate learning processes when they determine and\naccomplish learning goals; instructors, in effect, support rather than dictate learning\nresponsibility (Dochy et al.2003). By varying the locus of perceived control, students\nmaintain personal responsibility for learning as they utilize external resources. As depicted\nin Fig. 1 autonomy supports two roles in SCL: sovereignty and responsibility. In terms of\nsovereignty, students assume the power and control to determine learning goals, decisions,\nand actions required to achieve those goals. When encouraged to make decisions, students\nperceive it as taking control of their learning and develop personal ownership. For\nresponsibility, students become accountable for the consequences of their goals, decisions,\nand actions. They assume responsibility for managing their learning processes and project\ncompletion.\nDesigners and practitioners of SCL should incorporate the notion of autonomy with\ncaution. Autonomy is not synonymous with independence, but rather involves how self-\ndetermination re\ufb02ects one\u2019s will.

actions evoked voluntarily to address external expectations, rules, and\npressures (Ricoeur 1966; Reeve et al. 2002). Similarly, autonomy does not necessarily\nequate to acting without regard to constraints or demands (Dworkin 1988). An individual\nmay exhibit self-determination even when acting in accordance with external demands\nwhen he or she fully concurs with or endorses the value of the activity (Ryan and Deci\n2006).\nFurthermore, autonomy does not suggest an in\ufb01nite number of options, choices, or\ndecisions to make. Schwartz ( 2000) suggested that having too many options may prove\ncounterproductive. Ryan and Deci ( 2006) clari\ufb01ed that SDT advocates facilitating the\nindividual\u2019s experience of volition rather than providing unlimited choice options. One can\nhave many options yet fail to perceive autonomy, instead feeling resentful toward investing\neffort associated with decision-making. Alternatively, providing only a single option may\nimprove perceived autonomy when one truly endorses that option. Fostering autonomous\nmotivation involves more than providing opportunities for making individual choices and\ndecisions; autonomy involves endorsement of the activities in which one engages.\nAutonomy support facilitates a student\u2019s pursuit of individual goals and their\nendorsement of externally assigned activities. Reeve and Jang ( 2006) de\ufb01ned autonomy\nsupport as \u2018\u2018the interpersonal behavior one person provides to involve and nurture another\nperson\u2019s internally locused, volitional intentions to act\u2019 \u2019 (p. 210). Students perceive\nautonomy in their learning when teachers support their interests, preferences, values, and\npsychological needs (Deci and Ryan2000). Supportive learning environments provide a\ncompelling rationale for why and how assignments are designed; provide opportunities to\nmake individually relevant and interesting choices so students express psychological needs\nand integrate them into the classroom activities; allow time to work on a problem in\nindividual ways; empathize with students\u2019 perspectives; and avoid externally-controlling\nlanguages (e.g., \u2018\u2018you must\u2019\u2019) (Reeve and Jang2006).\nSeveral researchers have documented the positive in\ufb02uence of teacher\u2019s autonomy\nsupport on students\u2019 engagement, concentration, time management, self-regulation, and\nacademic performance (Jang et al.2010; Reeve 2006). Students may evolve and exhibit\nemotional connections with instructors who support their autonomy (Ryan et al. 2005). In\none college organic chemistry class, perceptions of instructor autonomy support were\nassociated with increases in student autonomous self-regulation, perceived competence,\nand interest and enjoyment, and corresponding decreases in anxiety. Changes in autono-\nmous self-regulation, in turn, were positively associated with students\u2019 course performance\n(Black and Deci2000).\nFig. 1 The role of autonomy in student-centered learning (adapted from Deci and Ryan 2000)\nE.

When combined with scaffolding,\nautonomy support proved effective in fostering students\u2019 self-regulation (Reeve et al.2004;\nSierens et al. 2009). Among elementary school students engaged in a digital learning task,\nproviding both autonomy support and structure yielded positive effects on both intrinsic\nmotivation and learning outcomes (van Loon et al.2012). This suggests that when\ninstructors provide guidance, directions, and expectations in autonomy-supportive ways,\nthey promote student engagement in student-centered learning and obtain desired learning\noutcomes. Conversely, when autonomous motivation is undermined, performance\ndecreases especially when applied to \ufb02exible, heuristic, creative, or complex capacities\n(Deci et al.1999). Therefore, autonomy is paramount where students engage complex\nproblems that require more than recall of basic knowledge and skills.\nScaffolding\nScaffolding refers to guidance provided to support one\u2019s independent functioning (Vy-\ngotsky1978). The concept of scaffolding in education adopted the metaphor of scaffolding\nfrom architectural construction. A temporary structure supports on the outside of a\nbuilding. As the building is gradually built permanently, the scaffold is removed. More\nknowledgeable others (instructors, peers, experts, or technology resources) guide and\nsupport an individual\u2019s learning. Scaffolds make available the knowledge, skill, strategies,\nand expertise of more knowledgeable others. When the individual demonstrates an\nacceptable level of competence, the scaffold is gradually faded to promote independent\nfunctioning.\nScaffolding is vital to students\u2019 success during SCL (Raes et al. 2012). Many students,\nespecially novices with limited background and experience in a domain, require explicit\nstructure to make sense of content, make informed decisions, monitor their progress, and\nadapt to emergent challenges. Scaffolding assists students to participate meaningfully by\nsupporting efforts to identify relevant goals, pursue and monitor progress toward those\ngoals, reconcile differences between existing understanding and concepts yet to be learned,\nand construct and re\ufb01ne artifacts (Hanna\ufb01n et al.2009). Scaffolding during SCL takes a\nwide array of strategies including providing discovery questions, peer feedback, archi-\ntectural solutions, explicit information, and step-by-step instructions (Azevedo and Hadwin\n2005; Brush and Saye 2000; Sharma and Hanna\ufb01n 2007; Weigend 2014).\nScaffolding sources may include peers, instructors, and technology. It can be more\neffective when scaffolding sources are provided together rather than applied separately.\nRoschelle et al. (2010) tested a mixed (peer and technology) scaffold with social incentives\nto ask questions, give explanations, and discuss disagreements about mathematics among\npeers. Fourth grade students who worked with peers in social activities using handheld\nnetworked devices performed superior on fraction problem solving than those who worked\nalone or on a desktop computer, suggesting group feedback and social processing through\nappropriate technology enhance engagement and learning. Similarly, Kim and Ryu\u2019s\n(2013) study also revealed that the combination of technology and peer scaffolding was\nmore effective than either source alone. Students using the Web-based formative peer\nassessment (WFPAS) technology demonstrated higher levels of re\ufb02ection and self-regu-\nlatory skills and performed better than those who engaged in peer feedback activity without\nassistance of WFPAS.\nSome scaffolds adapt to dynamic changes in the state of student understanding per\nindividual needs and progress.

In Aze-\nvedo\u2019s study ( 2005) on the effects of scaffolding on self-regulated learning, students who\nreceived dynamic scaffolds demonstrated increased activation of prior knowledge, greater\nchanges in mental models, more frequent and regulated planning and monitoring of pro-\ngress toward learning goals, and help seeking and effective strategy use than those who\nreceived either \ufb01xed or no scaffolding. Clarebout and Elen (2006) compared dynamic with\nstatic pedagogical agents to support complex problem solving skills in an open-ended\nlearning environment. College students who received adaptive (dynamic) advice outper-\nformed those who received advice at \ufb01xed time intervals.\nScaffolding purposes have been categorized as procedural (how to use learning envi-\nronment features), conceptual (what knowledge to consider), metacognitive (how to think\nabout the problem), and strategic (what the alternative strategies are) (Hanna\ufb01n et al.\n1999). Procedural scaffolds focus on operational, how-to features of the learning envi-\nronment (Hanna\ufb01n et al. 1999) and provide cognitive structure to assist students in com-\npleting tasks (Sharma and Hanna\ufb01n 2007). This scaffolding function reduces the learners\u2019\ncognitive load by providing step-by-step directions and directs their attention to important\naspects of the task. Procedural scaffolds are most effective when applied in combination\nwith complementary scaffolds. Davis and Linn (2000) scaffolded eighth graders\u2019 com-\npletion of speci\ufb01c science problem-solving activities, such as analyzing and critiquing\nclaims. Although activity prompts helped students complete the activity, they engendered\nfragmented knowledge of individual steps rather than the connections between and among\nthe separate steps. Not only procedural but also conceptual and strategic scaffolds were\nneeded to deepen the understanding of knowledge and strategies involved in the inquiry.\nConceptual scaffolds assist in linking and organizing knowledge related to a topic. This\nhelps students to determine what they already know, what they need to learn, how existing\nknowledge and to-be-learned content are related, and how new content can be organized\nwith respect to domain knowledge (Bulu and Pedersen2010). For example, MacGregor\nand Lou ( 2004) examined the in\ufb02uence of a conceptual scaffold on \ufb01fth graders\u2019 Web-\nQuest inquiries. The authors used a study guide and a concept map template to scaffold the\ncollection of relevant information and to connect information associated with the Web-\nQuest topic. They reported that the study guide scaffold helped to identify the information\nneeded to populate the concept map template by providing organizing and synthesizing\ncues. For college students in other studies, Chen and Bradshaw\u2019s (2007) knowledge\nintegration scaffolds emphasized critiquing, interpreting, and explaining key concepts in\neducational measurement. Undergraduate students read an instructional passage on relia-\nbility and validity as they worked to address an ill-structured problem. Students who\nreceived knowledge integration scaffolds made intentional efforts to identify concepts and\nrelationships and performed signi\ufb01cantly better when developing and justifying solutions\nand considering alternatives.\nStrategic scaffolds support individuals as they address challenges and consider multiple\nalternatives (Kim and Hanna\ufb01n 2011) by stimulating consideration of alternative strate-\ngies. Pedersen and Liu ( 2002), for example, examined the in\ufb02uence of an expert-based tool\non sixth graders\u2019 performance on solving novel science problems during Alien Rescue.\nThey compared three conditions: (a) modeling cognitive thinking process, (b) providing\ndidactic instructions on strategy use, and (c) giving strategic advice. The modeling group\nposed signi\ufb01cantly more relevant questions and performed signi\ufb01cantly better than the\nother two groups. Among novices, strategic scaffolding in the form of expert modeling\nenabled students to apply approaches employed by experts.

Re\ufb02ections on others\u2019 perspectives encourage students\nto assess potential shortcomings in their individual approaches and eventually modify their\napproach to ultimately improve performance (Choi et al.2005).\nMetacognitive scaffolds guide students in goal setting, planning, organizing, self-\nmonitoring, and self-evaluation (Zimmerman 1990). Metacognitive scaffolds can support\nthe development of two critical skills: domain knowledge acquisition and general self-\nregulatory strategies. Studies found that providing extensive metacognitive support serve\nstudents in transfer and retention of complex conceptual knowledge more effectively than\nminimal or intermediate support (Rodicio et al.2013). Wolf et al. ( 2003) provided\nmetacognitive scaffolds to support eighth graders\u2019 writing of a historical event. They used\ndomain speci\ufb01c guides that directed students to consider signi\ufb01cant aspects of the event as\nwell as self-regulatory guides that prompted them to re\ufb02ect on progress and plan for\nsubsequent activities. Their \ufb01ndings indicated that students who received scaffolding both\nwrote better accounts of the events and exhibited more task-focused and self-directed\nbehaviors than those who did not.\nAuthentic audiences\nConsistent with constructionist epistemology, artifacts resulted from SCL should be shared\nwith authentic, real world audiences. Authentic audiences are for whom student artifacts\nare designed, and they actually view, use, and critique the artifact. Traditionally, the typical\naudience of student work is the student\u2019s teacher. The teacher assesses the student\u2019s\nsubmission, and the artifact is not put to use beyond receiving a grade. Student artifact\ncreated for the real world audience vitalizes the authentic, lasting value beyond the teacher\nand the classroom.\nThe value of student artifacts is enhanced when they address real-world issues and\nspeci\ufb01c purposes (Wig\ufb01eld and Eccles 2000). For example, Cohen and Riel ( 1989)\ncompared students\u2019 writing for a course requirement with writing to peers at a distance.\nSeventh-grade students wrote two compositions on the same topic, one addressed to peers\nin other countries and the other only to their teacher. Signi\ufb01cantly higher ratings were\nreported for papers designed to communicate with peers than those written to demonstrate\ntheir skills to the teacher.\nTo solidify the authentic use of artifacts, artifacts can be disseminated to and used by\nother students in class, future students, and the society at large as well as globally. Kearney\nand Schuck (2006) described the in\ufb02uence of sharing student-generated videos among\nelementary and secondary schools in Australia. Student groups produced and subsequently\nshared digital videos with their peers.

Students can work autono-\nmously toward external goals when they endorse the value of the activity. To facilitate\nendorsement, instructors need to communicate the rationale\u2014why the activity is important\nfor their learning and how the activity is designed to facilitate the achievement of the\nbroader learning goal.

Choosing among several\noptions can increase students\u2019 perceptions of control over their actions (Reeve et al. 2004).\nWhen students are offered choices, they tend to spend additional time and effort on the\nactivity (Flowerday and Schraw2000) and obtain higher assignment completion rates\n(Patall et al. 2010). However, choice alone may not result in academic engagement and\nachievement. Recent research suggests that students interest in the topic as well as interest\nin the choices in\ufb02uence engagement (Flowerday and Shell2015). Schwartz ( 2000) cau-\ntioned too many choices are rather overwhelming and wasteful for decision-making. It is\nnot about the number of choices but choosing what is more personally relevant than\nothers. Providing choices facilitates an opportunity for students to pursue their own goals\nand interests, which is essential in motivating students (Hidi and Harackiewicz 2000).\nLearn it\nLearn it scaffolds accomplishment of goals. SCL proponents suggest scaffolding students\u2019\nefforts to formulate questions and inferences, monitor progress, identify and evaluate\nresources, re\ufb01ne thinking, and construct knowledge.Learn it provides procedural, con-\nceptual, strategic, and metacognitive scaffolding to guide student-centered inquiries.\nProcedural scaffolds provide step-by-step guides; conceptual scaffolds guide what to\nconsider; metacognitive scaffolds support learning management; and strategic scaffolds\nprovide alternatives to consider.\nDesign guideline 4: provide explicit directions on initiating engagement\nWhen students have limited prior knowledge and experience, misconceptions and na\u0131 \u00a8 ve\nassumptions may in\ufb02uence their SCL processes (Moos and Azevedo 2008; Shin et al.\n2003). A lack of prior domain-speci\ufb01c knowledge is particularly problematic in SCL since\nstudents initiate inquiries by generating questions based on their own knowledge and\nexperiences (Kim and Hanna\ufb01n2011). Activating existing schema by eliciting prior\nknowledge has been recognized as an important initial step of instruction (Gagne 1988;\nMerrill 2002). In such cases, direct instruction supports the acquisition of essential domain\nknowledge (Schwartz and Bransford 1998). Fixed, directive scaffolds can provide initial\nprocedural and conceptual support to reduce the cognitive load and help students initiate\nand pursue their goals under way (Weigend2014).\nDesign guideline 5: support the selection and use of tools and resources\nPrevious researchers established that students often lacked experience in locating and using\nresources (Hill and Hanna\ufb01n 2001). Thus, unsupported access and use of Web resources\ncan affect the accuracy and credibility of student products. Ineffective and inef\ufb01cient\nstrategies interfere with learning and cause frustration. Furthermore, many students fail to\nuse support devices available in their computer assisted, open-ended learning environment\n(Clarebout and Elen2006; Oliver and Hanna\ufb01n 2000). Expert models provide conceptual,\nprocedural, metacognitive, and strategic support regarding what to search for, where to\nlook, and whether such material is a valid or useful source (Pedersen and Liu2002).\nExperts can also (e.g., teacher or librarian) make visible the unobserved thought processes\nA design framework for enhancing engagement \u2026\n123", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3398, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0f06ba3-1e6a-45a6-aaa7-9f93695054a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0f06ba3-1e6a-45a6-aaa7-9f93695054a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1131080, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3b2fad5c-66a4-4236-ae29-f21a91408a68", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1131080, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "9bc60df9b77c56ab7c49d382b87abb1657495f94cc182ef832bf43cd82e2e94e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "experts use to guide their actions (Collins et al. 1991).

For conceptual scaffolding, questions prompt students to\nconsider content in ways to support construction of new knowledge or reorganization of\nexisting knowledge (Chen and Bradshaw2007). Procedural scaffolding, in the form of\n\u2018\u2018thinking before talking,\u2019\u2019 prompts can foster more active participation and effective\ninteractions in the group discussion and promoted individual higher-level thinking skills\n(Huang et al.2012). In terms of strategic prompts, guidance on how to pose questions and\nobtain explanation, justi\ufb01cation, information, and methods is essential since students often\nfail to ask strategic questions without having explicit support to do so (King1990; 1991).\nMetacognitive scaffolds helped students focus attention and monitor learning via think-\naloud protocols (Ge and Land2003; Ge et al. 2005).\nDesign guideline 7: integrate the terminology used in the discipline\nPrevious researchers cautioned that students may regard the artifact construction as arts\nand crafts rather than content learning (Hmelo et al. 2000). In a middle school science\nconstruction project, Kolodner et al. ( 2003) overcame this challenge by encouraging\nteachers to model scienti\ufb01c discourse while having students justify their decisions using\nappropriate scienti\ufb01c language. In postsecondary engineering education, mathematics is\nregarded as \u2018\u2018the language of engineering\u2019\u2019 (Dym1999, p. 6). Before engaging in engi-\nneering design curricula, students complete prerequisite mathematics courses. Dym ( 1999)\nsuggested that subsequent engineering curriculum should expand upon and build from\nmathematical languages as well as languages of design, such as graphical representations\nand computing. Instructors need to articulate connections between constructions and\ndomains by integrating the subject speci\ufb01c terms into the design process.\nDesign guideline 8: support students as they monitor progress\nStudents who are unfamiliar with SCL can become frustrated and shift their focus to\nreaching perfunctory, immediate outcomes. SCL requires that \u2018\u2018students possess not only\nthe content knowledge but also regulation of cognition, including modi\ufb01cation of plans,\nreevaluation of goals, and monitoring of one\u2019s own cognitive efforts\u2019 \u2019 (Shin et al.2003,\np. 23). However, research con\ufb01rms that students experience dif\ufb01culty monitoring their\nprogress, managing their time ef\ufb01ciently, and identifying areas in which they need assis-\ntance (Brush and Saye2000). Metacognitive scaffolds support the monitoring of inde-\npendent inquiry. Expert modeling, cognitive apprenticeships, question prompts, peer\nfeedback, and step-by-step check points support students as they monitor progress, re\ufb02ect\non what has been done, seek clari\ufb01cation, and identify needs.\nShare it\nShare it is designed to enhance student engagement by presenting and sharing products\nwith authentic audiences.

Students self-\nevaluate their understanding to assess options to translate into artifacts to represent\nintended interpretation. Audiences, in turn, provide different, potentially complementary or\ncompeting, perspectives on the product which affords opportunities to consider alterna-\ntives. By sharing creations, students gain a deeper understanding of others\u2019 perspectives\nand ideas related to the artifact (Evard 1996).\nDesign guideline 10: facilitate helpful peer review\nDuring peer reviews, students assume the role of trained peer reviewers and exchange\nwritten and spoken feedback on formative drafts and prototypes (Hansen and Liu 2005).\nAsking for and receiving alternative explanations enables students to assess and potentially\nrevise their representations (Lundstrom and Baker2009). Cho and Schunn ( 2007) found\nthat undergraduate students\u2019 informal science learning improved when they received\nfeedback from multiple peers versus those who only received feedback from a single\nexpert.\nHowever, scaffolding for peer review are often needed but overlooked (Belland 2014).\nAlthough often incorporated to promote social interaction and learning (Trautmann 2009),\nstudents reported negative attitudes toward peer review (Yang and Tsai 2010). Many\nstudents lack the experience or guidance needed to provide constructive reviews. Novice\nreviewers, for example, may provide super\ufb01cial or uninformed feedback due to limited\nbackground knowledge and experience. Effective peer review processes are facilitated and\nmonitored using complementary scaffolds, such as question prompts (Gan and Hattie2014)\nand coaching (Lam 2010). Guiding questions and rubrics can orient students\u2019 approach to\nreviewing peer products and articulating their feedback on them.\nUnresolved issues and future directions\nFew validated measures are currently available to document instructors\u2019 and students\u2019\nbeliefs and practices regarding SCL. Researchers will require validated and \ufb01eld-tested\ninstruments to assess the their in\ufb02uence on both engagement as well as learning processes\nand outcomes. While isolated efforts have been reported in the science (e.g., Erdogan et al.\n2011), teachers of adult learners (e.g., Conti 1990), autonomous motivation (e.g., Gorissen\net al. 2013) and perceived autonomy in education (e.g., Black and Deci 2000), we will need\nA design framework for enhancing engagement \u2026\n123", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3248, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b9f1ef2-21e1-4be5-a573-06e0f1c92355": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b9f1ef2-21e1-4be5-a573-06e0f1c92355", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1131080, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0ebfe98-57f1-4ff4-a9e7-c24008f2f14c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s11423-015-9422-5.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1131080, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "a37ea05dc07ca7fe63f5225b8da969f7242631747bd802e586e424ea0f0fa5c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "more consolidated, integrated models that address varied nuances and depths of applica-\ntions across.\nAdvances in assessment of academic achievement through SCL are also needed. Some\nresearchers have incorporated standardized norm- or criterion-referenced assessments as\nwell as alternative assessments such as self-assessment, peer assessment, rubrics, feedback,\nportfolios, and exhibition (Andrade et al.2012). The Jasper program (Cognition and\nTechnology Group at Vanderbilt 1992), for example, balanced expected performance\nmeasures with indicators of how well students were able to identify, evaluate, pursue and\nresolve problems. In addition to standardized test data, student performance was assessed\nusing alternative assessments such as Basic Math Concepts Test, Word Problem Test,\nPlanning Test, and Math Attitudes Questionnaire. Jasper students reported comparable\nperformance on standardized measures but superior performance in complex problem\nsolving, planning and subgoal comprehension questions, and improved attitudes toward\nmathematics. Further research is indicated to increase con\ufb01dence in students\u2019 self-\nassessment of their individual progress, outcomes, and strategies to manage their learning.\nFinally, whereas considerable scaffolding research and theory has been documented, we\nhave limited understanding as to how scaffold can accommodate varying levels of diverse\nstudent preparedness and motivation. For example, at-risk students, refugee youths, and\nEnglish as Foreign Language students, who under-perform historically and lack back-\nground and skills to engage their learning environments (Nelson et al. 2012), present needs\nin managing individual learning decisions. For the range of individuals, we need to\nscaffold uniquely different needs in order to empower them to assume ownership for their\nlearning.\nReferences\nAarts, H., Gollwitzer, P. M., & Hassin, R.

Improving educational \noutcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves \nhelping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and \neducational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve \ntheir learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their \nrelative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many \nstudents. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on \nthem, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, \nself-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, \npractice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice.\n T o offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize \nacross four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning conditions \ninclude aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies alone \nor with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary from \nsimple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures \nthat are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension.\n We attempted to provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is rather lengthy. However, we also wrote \nthe monograph in a modular fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is divided into the following sections:\n1.

What if \nstudents were instead adopting ineffective learning techniques \nthat undermined their achievement, or at least did not improve \nit? Shouldn\u2019t they stop using these techniques and begin using \nones that are effective? Psychologists have been developing \nand evaluating the efficacy of techniques for study and instruc-\ntion for more than 100 years. Nevertheless, some effective \ntechniques are underutilized\u2014many teachers do not learn \nabout them, and hence many students do not use them, despite \nevidence suggesting that the techniques could benefit student \nachievement with little added effort. Also, some learning tech-\nniques that are popular and often used by students are rela-\ntively ineffective. One potential reason for the disconnect \nbetween research on the efficacy of learning techniques and \ntheir use in educational practice is that because so many tech-\nniques are available, it would be challenging for educators to \nsift through the relevant research to decide which ones show \npromise of efficacy and could feasibly be implemented by stu-\ndents (Pressley, Goodchild, Fleet, Zajchowski, & Evans, \n1989).\nToward meeting this challenge, we explored the efficacy of \n10 learning techniques (listed in Table 1) that students could \nuse to improve their success across a wide variety of content \ndomains.1 The learning techniques we consider here were cho-\nsen on the basis of the following criteria. We chose some \ntechniques (e.g., self-testing, distributed practice) because an \ninitial survey of the literature indicated that they could improve \nstudent success across a wide range of conditions. Other tech-\nniques (e.g., rereading and highlighting) were included \nbecause students report using them frequently. Moreover, stu-\ndents are responsible for regulating an increasing amount of \ntheir learning as they progress from elementary grades through \nmiddle school and high school to college. Lifelong learners \nalso need to continue regulating their own learning, whether  \nit takes place in the context of postgraduate education, the \nworkplace, the development of new hobbies, or recreational \nactivities.\nThus, we limited our choices to techniques that could be \nimplemented by students without assistance (e.g., without \nrequiring advanced technologies or extensive materials that \nwould have to be prepared by a teacher). Some training may \nbe required for students to learn how to use a technique with \nfidelity, but in principle, students should be able to use the \ntechniques without supervision. We also chose techniques for \nwhich a sufficient amount of empirical evidence was available \nto support at least a preliminary assessment of potential effi-\ncacy. Of course, we could not review all the techniques that \nmeet these criteria, given the in-depth nature of our reviews, \nand these criteria excluded some techniques that show much \npromise, such as techniques that are driven by advanced \ntechnologies.\nBecause teachers are most likely to learn about these tech-\nniques in educational psychology classes, we examined  \nhow some educational-psychology textbooks covered them \n(Ormrod, 2008; Santrock, 2008; Slavin, 2009; Snowman, \nThe review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and particular variables of interest can be easily \ncompared across techniques.\n T o foreshadow our final recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their generalizability and promise \nfor improving student learning. Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility assessments because they benefit \nlearners of different ages and abilities and have been shown to boost students\u2019 performance across many criterion tasks and \neven in educational contexts. Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice received moderate utility \nassessments. The benefits of these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite their promise, they fell short \nof a high utility assessment because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance, elaborative interrogation and self-\nexplanation have not been adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of interleaving have just begun to be \nsystematically explored, so the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques \nthat received moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in appropriate situations, which we \ndescribe in detail within the review of each technique.\n Five techniques received a low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text \nlearning, and rereading.

Despite the promise of some of the tech-\nniques, many of these textbooks did not provide sufficient \ncoverage, which would include up-to-date reviews of their \nefficacy and analyses of their generalizability and potential \nlimitations. Accordingly, for all of the learning techniques \nlisted in Table 1, we reviewed the literature to identify the gen-\neralizability of their benefits across four categories of vari-\nables\u2014materials, learning conditions, student characteristics, \nand criterion tasks. The choice of these categories was inspired \nby Jenkins\u2019 (1979) model (for an example of its use in educa-\ntional contexts, see Marsh & Butler, in press), and examples of \neach category are presented in Table 2. Materials pertain to the \nspecific content that students are expected to learn, remember, \nor comprehend. Learning conditions pertain to aspects of  \nthe context in which students are interacting with the to-be-\nlearned materials. These conditions include aspects of the \nlearning environment itself (e.g., noisiness vs. quietness in a \nclassroom), but they largely pertain to the way in which a \nlearning technique is implemented. For instance, a technique \ncould be used only once or many times (a variable referred to \nas dosage) when students are studying, or a technique could be \nused when students are either reading or listening to the to-be-\nlearned materials.\nAny number of student characteristics could also influence \nthe effectiveness of a given learning technique. For example, \nin comparison to more advanced students, younger students in \nearly grades may not benefit from a technique. Students\u2019 basic \ncognitive abilities, such as working memory capacity or gen-\neral fluid intelligence, may also influence the efficacy of a \ngiven technique.

Students with some \ndomain knowledge about a topic may also find it easier to use \nself-explanation and elaborative interrogation, which are two \ntechniques that involve answering \u201cwhy\u201d questions about a \nparticular concept (e.g., \u201cWhy would particles of ice rise up \nwithin a cloud?\u201d). Domain knowledge may enhance the bene-\nfits of summarization and highlighting as well. Nevertheless, \nalthough some domain knowledge will benefit students as \nthey begin learning new content within a given domain, it is \nnot a prerequisite for using most of the learning techniques.\nThe degree to which the efficacy of each learning technique \nobtains across long retention intervals and generalizes across \ndifferent criterion tasks is of critical importance. Our reviews \nand recommendations are based on evidence, which typically \npertains to students\u2019 objective performance on any number of \ncriterion tasks. Criterion tasks (Table 2, rightmost column) \nvary with respect to the specific kinds of knowledge that they \ntap. Some tasks are meant to tap students\u2019 memory for infor-\nmation (e.g., \u201cWhat is operant conditioning?\u201d), others are \nlargely meant to tap students\u2019 comprehension (e.g., \u201cExplain \nthe difference between classical conditioning and operant con-\nditioning\u201d), and still others are meant to tap students\u2019 applica-\ntion of knowledge (e.g., \u201cHow would you apply operant \nconditioning to train a dog to sit down?\u201d). Indeed, Bloom and \ncolleagues divided learning objectives into six categories, \nfrom memory (or knowledge) and comprehension of facts to \ntheir application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation (B. S. \nBloom, Engelhart, Furst, Hill, & Krathwohl, 1956; for an \nupdated taxonomy, see L. W. Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001).\nIn discussing how the techniques influence criterion perfor-\nmance, we emphasize investigations that have gone beyond \ndemonstrating improved memory for target material by mea-\nsuring students\u2019 comprehension, application, and transfer of \nknowledge. Note, however, that although gaining factual \nknowledge is not considered the only or ultimate objective of \nschooling, we unabashedly consider efforts to improve student \nretention of knowledge as essential for reaching other instruc-\ntional objectives; if one does not remember core ideas, facts, \nor concepts, applying them may prove difficult, if not impos-\nsible. Students who have forgotten principles of algebra will \nbe unable to apply them to solve problems or use them as a \nfoundation for learning calculus (or physics, economics, or \nother related domains), and students who do not remember \nwhat operant conditioning is will likely have difficulties \napplying it to solve behavioral problems. We are not advocat-\ning that students spend their time robotically memorizing \nfacts; instead, we are acknowledging the important interplay \nbetween memory for a concept on one hand and the ability to \ncomprehend and apply it on the other.\nAn aim of this monograph is to encourage students to use \nthe appropriate learning technique (or techniques) to accom-\nplish a given instructional objective. Some learning techniques \nare largely focused on bolstering students\u2019 memory for facts \n(e.g., the keyword mnemonic), others are focused more on \nimproving comprehension (e.g., self-explanation), and yet \nothers may enhance both memory and comprehension (e.g., \npractice testing). Thus, our review of each learning technique \ndescribes how it can be used, its effectiveness for producing \nlong-term retention and comprehension, and its breadth of \nefficacy across the categories of variables listed in Table 2.\nReviewing the Learning T echniques\nIn the following series of reviews, we consider the available \nevidence for the efficacy of each of the learning techniques. \nEach review begins with a brief description of the technique \nand a discussion about why it is expected to improve student \nlearning.

Humans are inquisitive \ncreatures by nature, attuned to seeking explanations for states, \nactions, and events in the world around us. Fortunately, a siz-\nable body of evidence suggests that the power of explanatory \nquestioning can be harnessed to promote learning. Specifi-\ncally, research on both elaborative interrogation and self-\nexplanation has shown that prompting students to answer \n\u201cWhy?\u201d questions can facilitate learning. These two literatures \nare highly related but have mostly developed independently of \none another. Additionally, they have overlapping but noniden-\ntical strengths and weaknesses. For these reasons, we consider \nthe two literatures separately.\n1.1 General description of elaborative interrogation and \nwhy it should work. In one of the earliest systematic studies \nof elaborative interrogation, Pressley, McDaniel, Turnure, \nWood, and Ahmad (1987) presented undergraduate students \nwith a list of sentences, each describing the action of a particu-\nlar man (e.g., \u201cThe hungry man got into the car\u201d). In the elab-\norative-interrogation group, for each sentence, participants \nwere prompted to explain \u201cWhy did that particular man do \nthat?\u201d Another group of participants was instead provided \nwith an explanation for each sentence (e.g., \u201cThe hungry man \ngot into the car to go to the restaurant\u201d), and a third group \nsimply read each sentence. On a final test in which participants \nwere cued to recall which man performed each action (e.g., \n\u201cWho got in the car?\u201d), the elaborative-interrogation group \nsubstantially outperformed the other two groups (collapsing \nacross experiments, accuracy in this group was approximately \n72%, compared with approximately 37% in each of the other \ntwo groups). From this and similar studies, Seifert (1993) \nreported average effect sizes ranging from 0.85 to 2.57.\nAs illustrated above, the key to elaborative interrogation \ninvolves prompting learners to generate an explanation for an \nexplicitly stated fact. The particular form of the explanatory \nprompt has differed somewhat across studies\u2014examples \ninclude \u201cWhy does it make sense that\u2026?\u201d, \u201cWhy is this true?\u201d, \nand simply \u201cWhy?\u201d However, the majority of studies have \nused prompts following the general format, \u201cWhy would this \nfact be true of this [X] and not some other [X]?\u201d\nThe prevailing theoretical account of elaborative-interroga-\ntion effects is that elaborative interrogation enhances learning \nby supporting the integration of new information with existing \nprior knowledge. During elaborative interrogation, learners \npresumably \u201cactivate schemata . . . These schemata, in turn, \nhelp to organize new information which facilitates retrieval\u201d \n(Willoughby & Wood, 1994, p. 140). Although the integration \nof new facts with prior knowledge may facilitate the organiza-\ntion (Hunt, 2006) of that information, organization alone is not \nsufficient\u2014students must also be able to discriminate among \nrelated facts to be accurate when identifying or using the \nlearned information (Hunt, 2006). Consistent with this account, \nnote that most elaborative-interrogation prompts explicitly or \nimplicitly invite processing of both similarities and differences \nbetween related entities (e.g., why a fact would be true of one \nprovince versus other provinces). As we highlight below, pro-\ncessing of similarities and differences among to-be-learned \nfacts also accounts for findings that elaborative-interrogation \neffects are often larger when elaborations are precise rather \nthan imprecise, when prior knowledge is higher rather than \nlower (consistent with research showing that preexisting \nknowledge enhances memory by facilitating distinctive pro-\ncessing; e.g., Rawson & Van Overschelde, 2008), and when \nelaborations are self-generated rather than provided (a finding \nconsistent with research showing that distinctiveness effects \ndepend on self-generating item-specific cues; Hunt & Smith, \n1996).\n1.2 How general are the effects of elaborative \ninterrogation?\n1.2a Learning conditions.

The seminal work by Pressley et al. \n(1987; see also B. S. Stein & Bransford, 1979) spawned a \nflurry of research in the following decade that was primarily \ndirected at assessing the generalizability of elaborative-inter-\nrogation effects. Some of this work focused on investigating \nelaborative-interrogation effects under various learning condi-\ntions. Elaborative-interrogation effects have been consistently \nshown using either incidental or intentional learning instruc-\ntions (although two studies have suggested stronger effects for \nincidental learning: Pressley et al., 1987; Woloshyn, Wil-\nloughby, Wood, & Pressley, 1990). Although most studies \nhave involved individual learning, elaborative-interrogation \neffects have also been shown among students working in \ndyads or small groups (Kahl & Woloshyn, 1994; Woloshyn & \nStockley, 1995).\n1.2b Student characteristics. Elaborative-interrogation effects \nalso appear to be relatively robust across different kinds of \nlearners. Although a considerable amount of work has involved \nundergraduate students, an impressive number of studies have \nshown elaborative-interrogation effects with younger learners \nas well. Elaborative interrogation has been shown to improve \nlearning for high school students, middle school students, and \nupper elementary school students (fourth through sixth grad-\ners). The extent to which elaborative interrogation benefits \nyounger learners is less clear. Miller and Pressley (1989) did \nnot find effects for kindergartners or first graders, and Wood, \nMiller, Symons, Canough, and Yedlicka (1993) reported \nmixed results for preschoolers. Nonetheless, elaborative inter-\nrogation does appear to benefit learners across a relatively \nwide age range. Furthermore, several of the studies involving \nyounger students have also established elaborative-interroga-\ntion effects for learners of varying ability levels, including \nfourth through twelfth graders with learning disabilities (C. \nGreene, Symons, & Richards, 1996; Scruggs, Mastropieri, & \nSullivan, 1994) and sixth through eighth graders with mild", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4145, "end_char_idx": 6329, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77989a58-d59a-45ee-9e24-afe4ac84a497": {"__data__": {"id_": "77989a58-d59a-45ee-9e24-afe4ac84a497", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2c77754-dd3c-473e-b30c-70cf84956703", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "183a0a6f970ab40a5868879aad6d5ce8f59404501cd201dd853adc0161ac5a37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2e44225-c835-491b-9b4f-2b5a373efabf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ba0ae817cdb54cc7eb7c2589de2c6a610684e6223912684db03f4363a21e51b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Improving Student Achievement 9\ncognitive disabilities (Scruggs, Mastropieri, Sullivan, & Hes-\nser, 1993), although Wood, Willoughby, Bolger, Younger, and \nKaspar (1993) did not find effects with a sample of low-\nachieving students. On the other end of the continuum, elabo-\nrative-interrogation effects have been shown for high-achieving \nfifth and sixth graders (Wood & Hewitt, 1993; Wood, Wil-\nloughby, et al., 1993).\nAnother key dimension along which learners differ is level \nof prior knowledge, a factor that has been extensively investi-\ngated within the literature on elaborative interrogation. Both \ncorrelational and experimental evidence suggest that prior \nknowledge is an important moderator of elaborative-interroga-\ntion effects, such that effects generally increase as prior  \nknowledge increases. For example, Woloshyn, Pressley, and \nSchneider (1992) presented Canadian and German students \nwith facts about Canadian provinces and German states. Thus, \nboth groups of students had more domain knowledge for one \nset of facts and less domain knowledge for the other set. As \nshown in Figure 1, students showed larger effects of elabora-\ntive interrogation in their high-knowledge domain (a 24% \nincrease) than in their low-knowledge domain (a 12% \nincrease). Other studies manipulating the familiarity of to-be-\nlearned materials have reported similar patterns, with signifi-\ncant effects for new facts about familiar items but weaker or \nnonexistent effects for facts about unfamiliar items. Despite \nsome exceptions (e.g., Ozgungor & Guthrie, 2004), the overall \nconclusion that emerges from the literature is that high-knowl-\nedge learners will generally be best equipped to profit from the \nelaborative-interrogation technique. The benefit for lower-\nknowledge learners is less certain.\nOne intuitive explanation for why prior knowledge moder-\nates the effects of elaborative interrogation is that higher \nknowledge permits the generation of more appropriate expla-\nnations for why a fact is true. If so, one might expect final-test \nperformance to vary as a function of the quality of the explana-\ntions generated during study. However, the evidence is mixed. \nWhereas some studies have found that test performance is bet-\nter following adequate elaborative-interrogation responses \n(i.e., those that include a precise, plausible, or accurate expla-\nnation for a fact) than for inadequate responses, the differences \nhave often been small, and other studies have failed to find \ndifferences (although the numerical trends are usually in the \nanticipated direction). A somewhat more consistent finding is \nthat performance is better following an adequate response than \nno response, although in this case, too, the results are some-\nwhat mixed. More generally, the available evidence should be \ninterpreted with caution, given that outcomes are based on \nconditional post hoc analyses that likely reflect item-selection \neffects. Thus, the extent to which elaborative-interrogation \neffects depend on the quality of the elaborations generated is \nstill an open question.\n1.2c Materials. Although several studies have replicated \nelaborative-interrogation effects using the relatively artificial \n\u201cman sentences\u201d used by Pressley et al. (1987), the majority of \nsubsequent research has extended these effects using materials \nthat better represent what students are actually expected to \nlearn. The most commonly used materials involved sets of \nfacts about various familiar and unfamiliar animals (e.g., \u201cThe \nWestern Spotted Skunk\u2019s hole is usually found on a sandy \npiece of farmland near crops\u201d), usually with an elaborative-\ninterrogation prompt following the presentation of each fact. \nOther studies have extended elaborative-interrogation effects \nto fact lists from other content domains, including facts  \nabout U.S. states, German states, Canadian provinces, and  \nuniversities; possible reasons for dinosaur extinction; and  \ngender-specific facts about men and women. Other studies \nhave shown elaborative-interrogation effects for factual state-\nments about various topics (e.g., the solar system) that are nor-\nmatively consistent or inconsistent with learners\u2019 prior beliefs \n(e.g., Woloshyn, Paivio, & Pressley, 1994).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4255, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2e44225-c835-491b-9b4f-2b5a373efabf": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2e44225-c835-491b-9b4f-2b5a373efabf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2c77754-dd3c-473e-b30c-70cf84956703", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "183a0a6f970ab40a5868879aad6d5ce8f59404501cd201dd853adc0161ac5a37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "77989a58-d59a-45ee-9e24-afe4ac84a497", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "3ba2be0d8d28349f85d842f485b36b1bf85e907b9cb6fda1a29f25a19bc71350", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The most commonly used materials involved sets of \nfacts about various familiar and unfamiliar animals (e.g., \u201cThe \nWestern Spotted Skunk\u2019s hole is usually found on a sandy \npiece of farmland near crops\u201d), usually with an elaborative-\ninterrogation prompt following the presentation of each fact. \nOther studies have extended elaborative-interrogation effects \nto fact lists from other content domains, including facts  \nabout U.S. states, German states, Canadian provinces, and  \nuniversities; possible reasons for dinosaur extinction; and  \ngender-specific facts about men and women.

In sum, whereas elaborative-interrogation effects \non associative memory have been firmly established, the \nextent to which elaborative interrogation facilitates recall or \ncomprehension is less certain.\nOf even greater concern than the limited array of measures \nthat have been used is the fact that few studies have examined \nperformance after meaningful delays. Almost all prior studies \nhave administered outcome measures either immediately or \nwithin a few minutes of the learning phase. Results from the \nfew studies that have used longer retention intervals are prom-\nising. Elaborative-interrogation effects have been shown after \ndelays of 1\u20132 weeks (Scruggs et al., 1994; Woloshyn et al., \n1994), 1\u20132 months (Kahl & Woloshyn, 1994; Willoughby, \nWaller, Wood, & MacKinnon, 1993; Woloshyn & Stockley, \n1995), and even 75 and 180 days (Woloshyn et al., 1994). In \nalmost all of these studies, however, the delayed test was pre-\nceded by one or more criterion tests at shorter intervals, intro-\nducing the possibility that performance on the delayed test was \ncontaminated by the practice provided by the preceding tests. \nThus, further work is needed before any definitive conclusions \ncan be drawn about the extent to which elaborative interroga-\ntion produces durable gains in learning.\n1.3 Effects in representative educational contexts. Con-\ncerning the evidence that elaborative interrogation will \nenhance learning in representative educational contexts, few \nstudies have been conducted outside the laboratory. However, \noutcomes from a recent study are suggestive (B. L. Smith  \net al., 2010). Participants were undergraduates enrolled in an \nintroductory biology course, and the experiment was con-\nducted during class meetings in the accompanying lab section. \nDuring one class meeting, students completed a measure of \nverbal ability and a prior-knowledge test over material that \nwas related, but not identical, to the target material. In the fol-\nlowing week, students were presented with a lengthy text on \nhuman digestion that was taken from a chapter in the course \ntextbook. For half of the students, 21 elaborative interrogation \nprompts were interspersed throughout the text (roughly one \nprompt per 150 words), each consisting of a paraphrased state-\nment from the text followed by \u201cWhy is this true?\u201d The \nremaining students were simply instructed to study the text at \ntheir own pace, without any prompts.

One possible merit of elabo-\nrative interrogation is that it apparently requires minimal train-\ning. In the majority of studies reporting elaborative-interrogation \neffects, learners were given brief instructions and then prac-\nticed generating elaborations for 3 or 4 practice facts (some-\ntimes, but not always, with feedback about the quality of the \nelaborations) before beginning the main task. In some studies, \nlearners were not provided with any practice or illustrative \nexamples prior to the main task. Additionally, elaborative \ninterrogation appears to be relatively reasonable with respect \nto time demands. Almost all studies set reasonable limits on \nthe amount of time allotted for reading a fact and for generat-\ning an elaboration (e.g., 15 seconds allotted for each fact).  \nIn one of the few studies permitting self-paced learning, the \ntime-on-task difference between the elaborative-interrogation \nand reading-only groups was relatively minimal (32 minutes \nvs. 28 minutes; B. L. Smith et al., 2010). Finally, the consis-\ntency of the prompts used across studies allows for relatively \nstraightforward recommendations to students about the nature \nof the questions they should use to elaborate on facts during \nstudy.\nWith that said, one limitation noted above concerns the \npotentially narrow applicability of elaborative interrogation to \ndiscrete factual statements. As Hamilton (1997) noted, \u201celabo-\nrative interrogation is fairly prescribed when focusing on a list \nof factual sentences. However, when focusing on more com-\nplex outcomes, it is not as clear to what one should direct the \n\u2018why\u2019 questions\u201d (p. 308). For example, when learning about a \ncomplex causal process or system (e.g., the digestive system), \nthe appropriate grain size for elaborative interrogation is an \nopen question (e.g., should a prompt focus on an entire system \nor just a smaller part of it?). Furthermore, whereas the facts to \nbe elaborated are clear when dealing with fact lists, elaborat-\ning on facts embedded in lengthier texts will require students \nto identify their own target facts.

We rate \nelaborative interrogation as having moderate utility. Elabora-\ntive-interrogation effects have been shown across a relatively \nbroad range of factual topics, although some concerns remain \nabout the applicability of elaborative interrogation to material \nthat is lengthier or more complex than fact lists. Concerning \nlearner characteristics, effects of elaborative interrogation \nhave been consistently documented for learners at least as \nyoung as upper elementary age, but some evidence suggests \nthat the benefits of elaborative interrogation may be limited \nfor learners with low levels of domain knowledge. Concerning \ncriterion tasks, elaborative-interrogation effects have been \nfirmly established on measures of associative memory admin-\nistered after short delays, but firm conclusions about the extent \nto which elaborative interrogation benefits comprehension or \nthe extent to which elaborative-interrogation effects persist \nacross longer delays await further research. Further research \ndemonstrating the efficacy of elaborative interrogation in rep-\nresentative educational contexts would also be useful. In sum, \nthe need for further research to establish the generalizability of \nelaborative-interrogation effects is primarily why this tech-\nnique did not receive a high-utility rating.\n2 Self-explanation\n2.1 General description of self-explanation and why it \nshould work. In the seminal study on self-explanation, Berry \n(1983) explored its effects on logical reasoning using the \nWason card-selection task. In this task, a student might see \nfour cards labeled \u201cA,\u201d \u201c4,\u201d \u201cD,\u201d and \u201c3\" and be asked to indi-\ncate which cards must be turned over to test the rule \u201cif a card \nhas A on one side, it has 3 on the other side\u201d (an instantiation \nof the more general \u201cif P, then Q\u201d rule). Students were first \nasked to solve a concrete instantiation of the rule (e.g., flavor \nof jam on one side of a jar and the sale price on the other); \naccuracy was near zero. They then were provided with a mini-\nmal explanation about how to solve the \u201cif P, then Q\u201d rule and \nwere given a set of concrete problems involving the use of this \nand other logical rules (e.g., \u201cif P, then not Q\u201d). For this set of \nconcrete practice problems, one group of students was \nprompted to self-explain while solving each problem by stat-\ning the reasons for choosing or not choosing each card. \nAnother group of students solved all problems in the set and \nonly then were asked to explain how they had gone about solv-\ning the problems. Students in a control group were not \nprompted to self-explain at any point. Accuracy on the prac-\ntice problems was 90% or better in all three groups. However, \nwhen the logical rules were instantiated in a set of abstract \nproblems presented during a subsequent transfer test, the two \nself-explanation groups substantially outperformed the control \ngroup (see Fig. 2). In a second experiment, another control \ngroup was explicitly told about the logical connection between \nthe concrete practice problems they had just solved and the \nforthcoming abstract problems, but they fared no better (28%).\nAs illustrated above, the core component of self-explana-\ntion involves having students explain some aspect of their pro-\ncessing during learning. Consistent with basic theoretical \nassumptions about the related technique of elaborative inter-\nrogation, self-explanation may enhance learning by support-\ning the integration of new information with existing prior \nknowledge. However, compared with the consistent prompts \nused in the elaborative-interrogation literature, the prompts \nused to elicit self-explanations have been much more variable \nacross studies. Depending on the variation of the prompt used, \nthe particular mechanisms underlying self-explanation effects \nmay differ somewhat.

For present purposes, we \nlimit our review to studies that have used prompts that are \nrelatively content-free. Although many of the content-specific \nprompts do elicit explanations, the relatively structured nature \nof these prompts would require teachers to construct sets of \nspecific prompts to put into practice, rather than capturing a \nmore general technique that students could be taught to use on \ntheir own. Furthermore, in some studies that have been situ-\nated in the self-explanation literature, the nature of the prompts \nis functionally more closely aligned with that of practice \ntesting.\nEven within the set of studies selected for review here, con-\nsiderable variability remains in the self-explanation prompts \nthat have been used. Furthermore, the range of tasks and mea-\nsures that have been used to explore self-explanation is quite \nlarge. Although we view this range as a strength of the litera-\nture, the variability in self-explanation prompts, tasks, and \nmeasures does not easily support a general summative state-\nment about the mechanisms that underlie self-explanation \neffects.\n2.2 How general are the effects of self-explanation?\n2.2a Learning conditions. Several studies have manipulated \nother aspects of learning conditions in addition to self-  \nexplanation. For example, Rittle-Johnson (2006) found that \nself-explanation was effective when accompanied by either \ndirect instruction or discovery learning. Concerning poten-\ntial moderating factors, Berry (1983) included a group who \nself-explained after the completion of each problem rather \nthan during problem solving. Retrospective self-explanation \ndid enhance performance relative to no self-explanation, but \nthe effects were not as pronounced as with concurrent self-\nexplanation. Another moderating factor may concern the \nextent to which provided explanations are made available to \nlearners. Schworm and Renkl (2006) found that self-expla-\nnation effects were significantly diminished when learners \ncould access explanations, presumably because learners \nmade minimal attempts to answer the explanatory prompts \nbefore consulting the provided information (see also Aleven \n& Koedinger, 2002).\n2.2b Student characteristics. Self-explanation effects have \nbeen shown with both younger and older learners. Indeed, \nself-explanation research has relied much less heavily on sam-\nples of college students than most other literatures have, with  \nat least as many studies involving younger learners as involv-\ning undergraduates. Several studies have reported self- \nexplanation effects with kindergartners, and other studies have \nshown effects for elementary school students, middle school \nstudents, and high school students.\nIn contrast to the breadth of age groups examined, the \nextent to which the effects of self-explanation generalize \nacross different levels of prior knowledge or ability has not \nbeen sufficiently explored. Concerning knowledge level, \nseveral studies have used pretests to select participants with \nrelatively low levels of knowledge or task experience, but no \nresearch has systematically examined self-explanation effects \nas a function of knowledge level. Concerning ability level, \nChi, de Leeuw, Chiu, and LaVancher (1994) examined the \neffects of self-explanation on learning from an expository text \nabout the circulatory system among participants in their sam-\nple who had received the highest and lowest scores on a mea-\nsure of general aptitude and found gains of similar magnitude \nin each group. In contrast, Didierjean and Cauzinille-Mar-\nm\u00e8che (1997) examined algebra-problem solving in a sample \nof ninth graders with either low or intermediate algebra skills, \nand they found self-explanation effects only for lower-skill \nstudents.

Across \nthose studies involving some form of problem-solving task, \nvirtually every study has shown self-explanation effects on \nnear-transfer tests in which students are asked to solve prob-\nlems that have the same structure as, but are nonidentical to, \nthe practice problems. Additionally, self-explanation effects \non far-transfer tests (in which students are asked to solve prob-\nlems that differ from practice problems not only in their sur-\nface features but also in one or more structural aspects) have \nbeen shown for the solving of math problems and pattern \nlearning. Thus, self-explanation facilitates an impressive range \nof learning outcomes.\nIn contrast, the durability of self-explanation effects is woe-\nfully underexplored. Almost every study to date has adminis-\ntered criterion tests within minutes of completion of the \nlearning phase. Only five studies have used longer retention \nintervals. Self-explanation effects persisted across 1\u20132 day \ndelays for playing chess endgames (de Bruin, Rikers, & \nSchmidt, 2007) and for retention of short narratives (Magliano, \nTrabasso, & Graesser, 1999). Self-explanation effects per-\nsisted across a 1-week delay for the learning of geometric \ntheorems (although an additional study session intervened \nbetween initial learning and the final test; R. M. F. Wong, \nLawson, & Keeves, 2002) and for learning from a text on the \ncirculatory system (although the final test was an open-book \ntest; Chi et al., 1994). Finally, Rittle-Johnson (2006) reported \nsignificant effects on performance in solving math problems \nafter a 2-week delay; however, the participants in this study \nalso completed an immediate test, thus introducing the possi-\nbility that testing effects influenced performance on the \ndelayed test. Taken together, the outcomes of these few studies \nare promising, but considerably more research is needed \nbefore confident conclusions can be made about the longevity \nof self-explanation effects.\n2.3 Effects in representative educational contexts. Con-\ncerning the strength of the evidence that self-explanation will \nenhance learning in educational contexts, outcomes from two \nstudies in which participants were asked to learn course-relevant \ncontent are at least suggestive. In a study by Schworm and \nRenkl (2006), students in a teacher-education program learned \nhow to develop example problems to use in their classrooms \nby studying samples of well-designed and poorly designed \nexample problems in a computer program. On each trial, stu-\ndents in a self-explanation group were prompted to explain \nwhy one of two examples was more effective than the other, \nwhereas students in a control group were not prompted to self-\nexplain. Half of the participants in each group were also given \nthe option to examine experimenter-provided explanations on \neach trial. On an immediate test in which participants selected \nand developed example problems, the self-explanation group \noutperformed the control group. However, this effect was lim-\nited to students who had not been able to view provided expla-\nnations, presumably because students made minimal attempts \nto self-explain before consulting the provided information.\nR. M. F. Wong et al. (2002) presented ninth-grade students \nin a geometry class with a theorem from the course textbook \nthat had not yet been studied in class. During the initial learn-\ning session, students were asked to think aloud while studying \nthe relevant material (including the theorem, an illustration of \nits proof, and an example of an application of the theorem to a \nproblem). Half of the students were specifically prompted to \nself-explain after every 1 or 2 lines of new information (e.g., \n\u201cWhat parts of this page are new to me? What does the state-\nment mean? Is there anything I still don\u2019t understand?\u201d), \nwhereas students in a control group received nonspecific \ninstructions that simply prompted them to think aloud during \nstudy. The following week, all students received a basic review \nof the theorem and completed the final test the next day. Self-\nexplanation did not improve performance on near-transfer \nquestions but did improve performance on far-transfer \nquestions.\n2.4 Issues for implementation.

As noted above, a particular \nstrength of the self-explanation strategy is its broad applicabil-\nity across a range of tasks and content domains. Furthermore, \nin almost all of the studies reporting significant effects of self-\nexplanation, participants were provided with minimal instruc-\ntions and little to no practice with self-explanation prior to \ncompleting the experimental task. Thus, most students appar-\nently can profit from self-explanation with minimal training.\nHowever, some students may require more instruction to \nsuccessfully implement self-explanation. In a study by Didier-\njean and Cauzinille-Marm\u00e8che (1997), ninth graders with \npoor algebra skills received minimal training prior to engaging \nin self-explanation while solving algebra problems; analysis \nof think-aloud protocols revealed that students produced many \nmore paraphrases than explanations. Several studies have \nreported positive correlations between final-test performance \nand both the quantity and quality of explanations generated by \nstudents during learning, further suggesting that the benefit of \nself-explanation might be enhanced by teaching students how \nto effectively implement the self-explanation technique (for \nexamples of training methods, see Ainsworth & Burcham, \n2007; R. M. F. Wong et al., 2002). However, in at least some \nof these studies, students who produced more or better-quality \nself-explanations may have had greater domain knowledge; if \nso, then further training with the technique may not have ben-\nefited the more poorly performing students. Investigating the \ncontribution of these factors (skill at self-explanation vs. \ndomain knowledge) to the efficacy of self-explanation will \nhave important implications for how and when to use this \ntechnique.\nAn outstanding issue concerns the time demands associated \nwith self-explanation and the extent to which self-explanation \neffects may have been due to increased time on task. Unfortu-\nnately, few studies equated time on task when comparing self-\nexplanation conditions to control conditions involving other \nstrategies or activities, and most studies involving self-paced \npractice did not report participants\u2019 time on task.

For example, Chi et al. (1994) prompted learn-\ners to self-explain after reading each sentence of an expository \ntext, which doubled the amount of time the group spent study-\ning the text relative to a rereading control group (125 vs. 66 \nminutes, respectively). With that said, Schworm and Renkl \n(2006) reported that time on task was not correlated with per-\nformance across groups, and Ainsworth and Burcham (2007) \nreported that controlling for study time did not eliminate \neffects of self-explanation.\nWithin the small number of studies in which time on  \ntask was equated, results were somewhat mixed. Three studies \nequating time on task reported significant effects of self- \nexplanation (de Bruin et al., 2007; de Koning, Tabbers, Rikers, \n& Paas, 2011; O\u2019Reilly, Symons, & MacLatchy-Gaudet, \n1998). In contrast, Matthews and Rittle-Johnson (2009) had \none group of third through fifth graders practice solving math \nproblems with self-explanation and a control group solve \ntwice as many practice problems without self-explanation; the \ntwo groups performed similarly on a final test. Clearly, further \nresearch is needed to establish the bang for the buck provided \nby self-explanation before strong prescriptive conclusions can \nbe made.\n2.5 Self-explanation: Overall assessment. We rate self-\nexplanation as having moderate utility. A major strength of \nthis technique is that its effects have been shown across differ-\nent content materials within task domains as well as across \nseveral different task domains. Self-explanation effects have \nalso been shown across an impressive age range, although fur-\nther work is needed to explore the extent to which these effects \ndepend on learners\u2019 knowledge or ability level. Self-explana-\ntion effects have also been shown across an impressive range \nof learning outcomes, including various measures of memory, \ncomprehension, and transfer. In contrast, further research is \nneeded to establish the durability of these effects across educa-\ntionally relevant delays and to establish the efficacy of self-\nexplanation in representative educational contexts. Although \nmost research has shown effects of self-explanation with mini-\nmal training, some results have suggested that effects may be \nenhanced if students are taught how to effectively implement \nthe self-explanation strategy. One final concern has to do with \nthe nontrivial time demands associated with self-explanation, \nat least at the dosages examined in most of the research that \nhas shown effects of this strategy.\n3 Summarization\nStudents often have to learn large amounts of information, \nwhich requires them to identify what is important and how dif-\nferent ideas connect to one another. One popular technique for \naccomplishing these goals involves having students write \nsummaries of to-be-learned texts. Successful summaries iden-\ntify the main points of a text and capture the gist of it while \nexcluding unimportant or repetitive material (A. L. Brown, \nCampione, & Day, 1981). Although learning to construct \naccurate summaries is often an instructional goal in its own \nright (e.g., Wade-Stein & Kintsch, 2004), our interest here \nconcerns whether doing so will boost students\u2019 performance \non later criterion tests that cover the target material.\n3.1 General description of summarization and why it \nshould work.

On \nboth the immediate and delayed tests, students in the summari-\nzation and note-taking groups performed best, followed by the \nstudents in the verbatim-copying and control groups, with the \nworst performance in the letter-search group (see Fig. 3).\nBretzing and Kulhavy\u2019s (1979) results fit nicely with the \nclaim that summarization boosts learning and retention \nbecause it involves attending to and extracting the higher-level \nmeaning and gist of the material. The conditions in the experi-\nment were specifically designed to manipulate how much stu-\ndents processed the texts for meaning, with the letter-search \ncondition involving shallow processing of the text that did not \nrequire learners to extract its meaning (Craik & Lockhart, \n1972). Summarization was more beneficial than that shallow \ntask and yielded benefits similar to those of note-taking, \nanother task known to boost learning (e.g., Bretzing & Kul-\nhavy, 1981; Crawford, 1925a, 1925b; Di Vesta & Gray, 1972). \nMore than just facilitating the extraction of meaning, however, \nsummarization should also boost organizational processing, \ngiven that extracting the gist of a text requires learners to  \nconnect disparate pieces of the text, as opposed to simply  \nevaluating its individual components (similar to the way in \nwhich note-taking affords organizational processing; Einstein,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3629, "end_char_idx": 6430, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5b8d7fa-7b3e-4445-8b52-a679bd112385": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5b8d7fa-7b3e-4445-8b52-a679bd112385", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d31362d2-b246-47c1-a9c9-9f7e2be58c78", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "5a9adc1588534f3059309c6d9afd02daf92f3efa869eefd0ef35abd0cf6dd469", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc617957-77ab-4289-a776-671143ebaead", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ffa8ac0b30328758c4d4135dae0f50b6c177ede7d9aa5c16b6067a4899aaaef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Improving Student Achievement 15\nMorris, & Smith, 1985). One last point should be made about \nthe results from Bretzing and Kulhavy (1979)\u2014namely, that \nsummarization and note-taking were both more beneficial \nthan was verbatim copying. Students in the verbatim-copying \ngroup still had to locate the most important information in the \ntext, but they did not synthesize it into a summary or rephrase \nit in their notes. Thus, writing about the important points in \none\u2019s own words produced a benefit over and above that of \nselecting important information; students benefited from the \nmore active processing involved in summarization and note-\ntaking (see Wittrock, 1990, and Chi, 2009, for reviews of \nactive/generative learning). These explanations all suggest \nthat summarization helps students identify and organize the \nmain ideas within a text.\nSo how strong is the evidence that summarization is a ben-\neficial learning strategy? One reason this question is difficult  \nto answer is that the summarization strategy has been imple-\nmented in many different ways across studies, making it diffi-\ncult to draw general conclusions about its efficacy. Pressley \nand colleagues described the situation well when they noted \nthat \u201csummarization is not one strategy but a family of strate-\ngies\u201d (Pressley, Johnson, Symons, McGoldrick, & Kurita, \n1989, p. 5). Depending on the particular instructions given, stu-\ndents\u2019 summaries might consist of single words, sentences, or \nlonger paragraphs; be limited in length or not; capture an entire \ntext or only a portion of it; be written or spoken aloud; or be \nproduced from memory or with the text present.\nA lot of research has involved summarization in some form, \nyet whereas some evidence demonstrates that summarization \nworks (e.g., L. W. Brooks, Dansereau, Holley, & Spurlin, \n1983; Doctorow, Wittrock, & Marks, 1978), T. H. Anderson \nand Armbruster\u2019s (1984) conclusion that \u201cresearch in support \nof summarizing as a studying activity is sparse indeed\u201d  \n(p. 670) is not outmoded. Instead of focusing on discovering \nwhen (and how) summarization works, by itself and without \ntraining, researchers have tended to explore how to train stu-\ndents to write better summaries (e.g., Friend, 2001; Hare & \nBorchardt, 1984) or to examine other benefits of training the \nskill of summarization. Still others have simply assumed that \nsummarization works, including it as a component in larger \ninterventions (e.g., Carr, Bigler, & Morningstar, 1991; Lee, \nLim, & Grabowski, 2010; Palincsar & Brown, 1984; Sp\u00f6rer, \nBrunstein, & Kieschke, 2009). When collapsing across find-\nings pertaining to all forms of summarization, summarization \nappears to benefit students, but the evidence for any one \ninstantiation of the strategy is less compelling.\nThe focus on training students to summarize reflects the \nbelief that the quality of summaries matters. If a summary does \nnot emphasize the main points of a text, or if it includes incor-\nrect information, why would it be expected to benefit learning \nand retention? Consider a study by Bednall and Kehoe (2011, \nExperiment 2), in which undergraduates studied six Web units \nthat explained different logical fallacies and provided examples \nof each. Of interest for present purposes are two groups: a con-\ntrol group who simply read the units and a group in which stu-\ndents were asked to summarize the material as if they were \nexplaining it to a friend. Both groups received the following \ntests: a multiple-choice quiz that tested information directly \nstated in the Web unit; a short-answer test in which, for each of \na list of presented statements, students were required to name \nthe specific fallacy that had been committed or write \u201cnot a fal-\nlacy\u201d if one had not occurred; and, finally, an application test \nthat required students to write explanations of logical fallacies \nin examples that had been studied (near transfer) as well as \nexplanations of fallacies in novel examples (far transfer).

Five days later, the stu-\ndents took an old/new recognition test; critical items were new \nstatements that captured the gist of the passage (as in Brans-\nford & Franks, 1971). Students who wrote better summaries \n(i.e., summaries that captured more important information) \nwere more likely to falsely recognize these gist statements, a \npattern suggesting that the students had extracted a higher-\nlevel understanding of the main ideas of the text.\n3.2 How general are the effects of summarization?\n3.2a Learning conditions. As noted already, many different \ntypes of summaries can influence learning and retention; sum-\nmarization can be simple, requiring the generation of only a \nheading (e.g., L. W. Brooks et al., 1983) or a single sentence \nper paragraph of a text (e.g., Doctorow et al., 1978), or it can be \nas complicated as an oral presentation on an entire set of stud-\nied material (e.g., Ross & Di Vesta, 1976). Whether it is better \nto summarize smaller pieces of a text (more frequent summari-\nzation) or to capture more of the text in a larger summary (less \nfrequent summarization) has been debated (Foos, 1995; Spur-\nlin, Dansereau, O\u2019Donnell, & Brooks, 1988). The debate \nremains unresolved, perhaps because what constitutes the most \neffective summary for a text likely depends on many factors \n(including students\u2019 ability and the nature of the material).\nOne other open question involves whether studied material \nshould be present during summarization. Hidi and Anderson \n(1986) pointed out that having the text present might help the \nreader to succeed at identifying its most important points as \nwell as relating parts of the text to one another. However, sum-\nmarizing a text without having it present involves retrieval, \nwhich is known to benefit memory (see the Practice Testing \nsection of this monograph), and also prevents the learner from \nengaging in verbatim copying. The Dyer et al. (1979) study \ndescribed earlier involved summarizing without the text pres-\nent; in this study, no overall benefit from summarizing \noccurred, even though information that had been included in \nsummaries was benefited (overall, this benefit was overshad-\nowed by costs to the greater amount of information that had \nnot been included in summaries). More generally, some stud-\nies have shown benefits from summarizing an absent text \n(e.g., Ross & Di Vesta, 1976), but some have not (e.g., M. C. \nM. Anderson & Thiede, 2008, and Thiede & Anderson, 2003, \nfound no benefits of summarization on test performance). The \nanswer to whether studied text should be present during sum-\nmarization is most likely a complicated one, and it may depend \non people\u2019s ability to summarize when the text is absent.\n3.2b Student characteristics. Benefits of summarization have \nprimarily been observed with undergraduates. Most of the \nresearch on individual differences has focused on the age of \nstudents, because the ability to summarize develops with age. \nYounger students struggle to identify main ideas and tend to \nwrite lower-quality summaries that retain more of the original \nwording and structure of a text (e.g., A. L. Brown & Day, \n1983; A. L. Brown, Day, & Jones, 1983). However, younger \nstudents (e.g., middle school students) can benefit from sum-\nmarization following extensive training (e.g., Armbruster, \nAnderson, & Ostertag, 1987; Bean & Steenwyk, 1984). For \nexample, consider a successful program for sixth-grade stu-\ndents (Rinehart, Stahl, & Erickson, 1986). Teachers received \n90 minutes of training so that they could implement summari-\nzation training in their classrooms; students then completed \nfive 45- to 50-minute sessions of training.

First, both general writing skill and interest \nin a topic have been linked to summarization ability in seventh \ngraders (Head, Readence, & Buss, 1989). Writing skill was \nmeasured via performance on an unrelated essay, and interest \nin the topic (American history) was measured via a survey that \nasked students how much they would like to learn about each \nof 25 topics. Of course, interest may be confounded with \nknowledge about a topic, and knowledge may also contribute \nto summarization skill.

The majority of studies have used prose pas-\nsages on such diverse topics as a fictitious primitive tribe, des-\nert life, geology, the blue shark, an earthquake in Lisbon, the \nhistory of Switzerland, and fictional stories. These passages \nhave ranged in length from a few hundred words to a few thou-\nsand words. Other materials have included Web modules and \nlectures. For the most part, characteristics of materials have \nnot been systematically manipulated, which makes it difficult \nto draw strong conclusions about this factor, even though 15 \nyears have passed since Hidi and Anderson (1986) made an \nargument for its probable importance. As discussed in Yu \n(2009), it makes sense that the length, readability, and organi-\nzation of a text might all influence a reader\u2019s ability to sum-\nmarize it, but these factors need to be investigated in studies \nthat manipulate them while holding all other factors constant \n(as opposed to comparing texts that vary along multiple \ndimensions).\n3.2d Criterion tasks. The majority of summarization studies \nhave examined the effects of summarization on either reten-\ntion of factual details or comprehension of a text (often requir-\ning inferences) through performance on multiple-choice \nquestions, cued recall questions, or free recall. Other benefits \nof summarization include enhanced metacognition (with text-\nabsent summarization improving the extent to which readers \ncan accurately evaluate what they do or do not know; M. C. M. \nAnderson & Thiede, 2008; Thiede & Anderson, 2003) and \nimproved note-taking following training (A. King, 1992; \nRinehart et al., 1986).\nWhereas several studies have shown benefits of summari-\nzation (sometimes following training) on measures of applica-\ntion (e.g., B. Y . L. Wong, Wong, Perry, & Sawatsky, 1986), \nothers have failed to find such benefits. For example, consider \na study in which L. F. Annis (1985) had undergraduates read a \npassage on an earthquake and then examined the consequences \nof summarization for performance on questions designed to \ntap different categories of learning within Bloom et al.\u2019s \n(1956) taxonomy. One week after learning, students who had \nsummarized performed no differently than students in a con-\ntrol group who had only read the passages in answering ques-\ntions that tapped a basic level of knowledge (fact and \ncomprehension questions). Students benefited from summari-\nzation when the questions required the application or analysis \nof knowledge, but summarization led to worse performance on \nevaluation and synthesis questions. These results need to be \nreplicated, but they highlight the need to assess the conse-\nquences of summarization on the performance of tasks that \nmeasure various levels of Bloom\u2019s taxonomy.\nAcross studies, results have also indicated that summariza-\ntion helps later performance on generative measures (e.g., free \nrecall, essays) more than it affects performance on multiple-\nchoice or other measures that do not require the student to pro-\nduce information (e.g., Bednall & Kehoe, 2011; L. W. Brooks \net al., 1983; J. R. King, Biggs, & Lipsky, 1984).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4354, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "749f9625-bc68-4ee3-8158-6fce8a8c57bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "749f9625-bc68-4ee3-8158-6fce8a8c57bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd6ead20-be3f-4f3f-b56f-c7802b3ffaac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "eb6d86341f84b0fa2b0e94e7542f1563c1223f591ea2a82a8f31227132c4a7ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7476ded8-09bf-4d09-bf13-a77a3684e299", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "d97c3a689ae4743bd92461f8fb09d700790448d789282e464bd8e40e06de9ba0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Students benefited from summari-\nzation when the questions required the application or analysis \nof knowledge, but summarization led to worse performance on \nevaluation and synthesis questions.

Because sum-\nmarizing requires production, the processing involved is likely \na better match to generative tests than to tests that depend on \nrecognition.\nUnfortunately, the one study we found that used a high-\nstakes test did not show a benefit from summarization training \n(Brozo, Stahl, & Gordon, 1985). Of interest for present pur-\nposes were two groups in the study, which was conducted with \ncollege students in a remedial reading course who received \ntraining either in summarization or in self-questioning (in the \nself-questioning condition, students learned to write multiple-\nchoice comprehension questions).

Students \nalso took a practice test before taking the actual Regents\u2019 exam. \nUnfortunately, the mean scores for both groups were at or \nbelow passing, for both the practice and actual exams.

Sev-\neral of the large summarization-training studies have been \nconducted in regular classrooms, indicating the feasibility of \ndoing so. For example, the study by A. King (1992) took place \nin the context of a remedial study-skills course for undergrad-\nuates, and the study by Rinehart et al. (1986) took place in \nsixth-grade classrooms, with the instruction led by students\u2019 \nregular teachers. In these and other cases, students benefited \nfrom the classroom training. We suspect it may actually be \nmore feasible to conduct these kinds of training studies in \nclassrooms than in the laboratory, given the nature of the time \ncommitment for students. Even some of the studies that did \nnot involve training were conducted outside the laboratory; for \nexample, in the Bednall and Kehoe (2011) study on learning \nabout logical fallacies from Web modules (see data in Table 3), \nthe modules were actually completed as a homework assign-\nment. Overall, benefits can be observed in classroom settings; \nthe real constraint is whether students have the skill to suc-\ncessfully summarize, not whether summarization occurs in the \nlab or the classroom.\n3.4 Issues for implementation. Summarization would be \nfeasible for undergraduates or other learners who already \nknow how to summarize. For these students, summarization \nwould constitute an easy-to-implement technique that would \nnot take a lot of time to complete or understand. The only \nconcern would be whether these students might be better \nserved by some other strategy, but certainly summarization \nwould be better than the study strategies students typically \nfavor, such as highlighting and rereading (as we discuss in the \nsections on those strategies below). A trickier issue would \nconcern implementing the strategy with students who are not \nskilled summarizers. Relatively intensive training programs \nare required for middle school students or learners with learn-\ning disabilities to benefit from summarization. Such efforts \nare not misplaced; training has been shown to benefit perfor-\nmance on a range of measures, although the training proce-\ndures do raise practical issues (e.g., Gajria & Salvia, 1992: \n6.5\u201311 hours of training used for sixth through ninth graders \nwith learning disabilities; Malone & Mastropieri, 1991: 2 \ndays of training used for middle school students with learning \ndisabilities; Rinehart et al., 1986: 45\u201350 minutes of instruc-\ntion per day for 5 days used for sixth graders). Of course, \ninstructors may want students to summarize material because \nsummarization itself is a goal, not because they plan to use \nsummarization as a study technique, and that goal may merit \nthe efforts of training.\nHowever, if the goal is to use summarization as a study \ntechnique, our question is whether training students would be \nworth the amount of time it would take, both in terms of the \ntime required on the part of the instructor and in terms of the \ntime taken away from students\u2019 other activities. For instance, \nin terms of efficacy, summarization tends to fall in the middle \nof the pack when compared to other techniques. In direct \ncomparisons, it was sometimes more useful than rereading \n(Rewey, Dansereau, & Peel, 1991) and was as useful as note-\ntaking (e.g., Bretzing & Kulhavy, 1979) but was less powerful \nthan generating explanations (e.g., Bednall & Kehoe, 2011) or \nself-questioning (A. King, 1992).\n3.5 Summarization: Overall assessment. On the basis of the \navailable evidence, we rate summarization as low utility. It can \nbe an effective learning strategy for learners who are already \nskilled at summarizing; however, many learners (including \nchildren, high school students, and even some undergraduates) \nwill require extensive training, which makes this strategy less \nfeasible. Our enthusiasm is further dampened by mixed find-\nings regarding which tasks summarization actually helps. \nAlthough summarization has been examined with a wide \nrange of text materials, many researchers have pointed to fac-\ntors of these texts that seem likely to moderate the effects of \nsummarization (e.g., length), and future research should be \naimed at investigating such factors.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4256, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f68ef4e-d2d3-419b-91ab-9125cc05b5a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f68ef4e-d2d3-419b-91ab-9125cc05b5a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1812d7e-cf24-41b7-ae71-bd9a9c7c0d4c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "0c653ec79a54103cb0f0fec49a3d1421a98a10fc9cf37b1c927dfbc21cda9977", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b56d8f0-d2a9-4547-bdf9-9a67b204d93d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "ab2716220efa5ce291dbb8acf1390195e48cd558280c287c7142a2d0ff25a630", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "3.5 Summarization: Overall assessment.

When students themselves are asked about what they \ndo when studying, they commonly report underlining, high-\nlighting, or otherwise marking material as they try to learn it \n(e.g., Cioffi, 1986; Gurung, Weidert, & Jeske, 2010). We treat \nthese techniques as equivalent, given that, conceptually, they \nshould work the same way (and at least one study found no \ndifferences between them; Fowler & Barker, 1974, Experi-\nment 2). The techniques typically appeal to students because \nthey are simple to use, do not entail training, and do not require \nstudents to invest much time beyond what is already required \nfor reading the material. The question we ask here is, will a \ntechnique that is so easy to use actually help students learn? To \nunderstand any benefits specific to highlighting and underlin-\ning (for brevity, henceforth referred to as highlighting), we do \nnot consider studies in which active marking of text was paired \nwith other common techniques, such as note-taking (e.g., \nArnold, 1942; L. B. Brown & Smiley, 1978; Mathews, 1938). \nAlthough many students report combining multiple techniques \n(e.g., L.

As an introduction to the rele-\nvant issues, we begin with a description of a prototypical \nexperiment. Fowler and Barker (1974, Exp. 1) had undergrad-\nuates read articles (totaling about 8,000 words) about boredom \nand city life from Scientific American and Science. Students \nwere assigned to one of three groups: a control group, in which \nthey only read the articles; an active-highlighting group, in \nwhich they were free to highlight as much of the texts as they \nwanted; or a passive-highlighting group, in which they read \nmarked texts that had been highlighted by yoked participants \nin the active-highlighting group. Everyone received 1 hour to \nstudy the texts (time on task was equated across groups); stu-\ndents in the active-highlighting condition were told to mark \nparticularly important material. All subjects returned to the lab \n1 week later and were allowed to review their original materi-\nals for 10 minutes before taking a 54-item multiple-choice \ntest. Overall, the highlighting groups did not outperform the \ncontrol group on the final test, a result that has unfortunately \nbeen echoed in much of the literature (e.g., Hoon, 1974; Idstein \n& Jenkins, 1972; Stordahl & Christensen, 1956).\nHowever, results from more detailed analyses of perfor -\nmance in the two highlighting groups are informative about \nwhat effects highlighting might have on cognitive processing. \nFirst, within the active-highlighting group, performance was \nbetter on test items for which the relevant text had been high-\nlighted (see Blanchard & Mikkelson, 1987; L. L. Johnson, \n1988 for similar results). Second, this benefit to highlighted \ninformation was greater for the active highlighters (who \nselected what to highlight) than for passive highlighters (who \nsaw the same information highlighted, but did not select it). \nThird, this benefit to highlighted information was accompa-\nnied by a small cost on test questions probing information that \nhad not been highlighted.\nTo explain such findings, researchers often point to a basic \ncognitive phenomenon known as the isolation effect, whereby \na semantically or phonologically unique item in a list is much \nbetter remembered than its less distinctive counterparts (see \nHunt, 1995, for a description of this work). For instance, if \nstudents are studying a list of categorically related words (e.g., \n\u201cdesk,\u201d \u201cbed,\u201d \u201cchair,\u201d \u201ctable\u201d) and a word from a different \ncategory (e.g., \u201ccow\u201d) is presented, the students will later be \nmore likely to recall it than they would if it had been studied in \na list of categorically related words (e.g., \u201cgoat,\u201d \u201cpig,\u201d \n\u201chorse,\u201d \u201cchicken\u201d). The analogy to highlighting is that a \nhighlighted, underlined, or capitalized sentence will \u201cpop out\u201d \nof the text in the same way that the word \u201ccow\u201d would if it \nwere isolated in a list of words for types of furniture. Consis-\ntent with this expectation, a number of studies have shown that \nreading marked text promotes later memory for the marked \nmaterial: Students are more likely to remember things that the \nexperimenter highlighted or underlined in the text (e.g., \nCashen & Leicht, 1970; Crouse & Idstein, 1972; Hartley, \nBartlett, & Branthwaite, 1980; Klare, Mabry, & Gustafson, \n1955; see Lorch, 1989 for a review).\nActively selecting information should benefit memory \nmore than simply reading marked text (given that the former \nwould capitalize on the benefits of generation, Slamecka & \nGraf, 1978, and active processing more generally, Faw & \nWaller, 1976).

However, active highlighting is not always better \nthan receiving material that has already been highlighted by an \nexperimenter (e.g., Nist & Hogrebe, 1987), probably because \nexperimenters will usually be better than students at highlight-\ning the most important parts of a text.\nMore generally, the quality of the highlighting is likely cru-\ncial to whether it helps students to learn (e.g., Wollen, Cone, \nBritcher, & Mindemann, 1985), but unfortunately, many stud-\nies have not contained any measure of the amount or the \nappropriateness of students\u2019 highlighting. Those studies that \nhave examined the amount of marked text have found great \nvariability in what students actually mark, with some students \nmarking almost nothing and others marking almost everything \n(e.g., Idstein & Jenkins, 1972). Some intriguing data came \nfrom the active-highlighting group in Fowler and Barker \n(1974). Test performance was negatively correlated (r = \u2013.29) \nwith the amount of text that had been highlighted in the active-\nhighlighting group, although this result was not significant \ngiven the small sample size (n = 19).\nMarking too much text is likely to have multiple conse-\nquences. First, overmarking reduces the degree to which \nmarked text is distinguished from other text, and people are \nless likely to remember marked text if it is not distinctive \n(Lorch, Lorch, & Klusewitz, 1995). Second, it likely takes less \nprocessing to mark a lot of text than to single out the most \nimportant details. Consistent with this latter idea, benefits of \nmarking text may be more likely to be observed when experi-\nmenters impose explicit limits on the amount of text students \nare allowed to mark. For example, Rickards and August (1975) \nfound that students limited to underlining a single sentence per \nparagraph later recalled more of a science text than did a no-\nunderlining control group. Similarly, L. L. Johnson (1988) \nfound that marking one sentence per paragraph helped college \nstudents in a reading class to remember the underlined infor-\nmation, although it did not translate into an overall benefit.\n4.2 How general are the effects of highlighting and under-\nlining? We have outlined hypothetical mechanisms by which \nhighlighting might aid memory, and particular features of \nhighlighting that would be necessary for these mechanisms to \nbe effective (e.g., highlighting only important material).

Because the research on high-\nlighting has not been particularly encouraging, few investiga-\ntions have systematically evaluated the factors that might \nmoderate the effectiveness of the technique\u2014for instance, we \ncould not include a Learning Conditions (4.2a) subsection \nbelow, given the lack of relevant evidence. To the extent the \nliterature permits, we sketch out the conditions known to mod-\nerate the effectiveness of highlighting. We also describe how \nour conclusion about the relative ineffectiveness of this tech-\nnique holds across a wide range of situations.\n4.2b Student characteristics. Highlighting has failed to help \nAir Force basic trainees (Stordahl & Christensen, 1956), chil-\ndren (e.g., Rickards & Denner, 1979), and remedial students \n(i.e., students who scored an average of 390 on the SAT verbal \nsection; Nist & Hogrebe, 1987), as well as prototypical under-\ngraduates (e.g., Todd & Kessler, 1971). It is possible that these \ngroups struggled to highlight only relevant text, given that \nother studies have suggested that most undergraduates over-\nmark text. Results from one study with airmen suggested that \nprior knowledge might moderate the effectiveness of high-\nlighting. In particular, the airmen read a passage on aircraft \nengines that either was unmarked (control condition) or had \nkey information underlined (Klare et al., 1955). The experi-\nmenters had access to participants\u2019 previously measured \nmechanical-aptitude scores and linked performance in the \nexperiment to those scores. The marked text was more helpful \nto airmen who had received high scores. This study involved \npremarked texts and did not examine what participants would \nhave underlined on their own, but it seems likely that students \nwith little knowledge of a topic would struggle to identify \nwhich parts of a text were more or less important (and thus \nwould benefit less from active highlighting than knowledge-\nable students would).\nOne other interesting possibility has come from a study in \nwhich experimenters extrinsically motivated participants by \npromising them that the top scorers on an exam would receive \n$5 (Fass & Schumacher, 1978). Participants read a text about \nenzymes; half the participants were told to underline key \nwords and phrases. All participants then took a 15-item multi-\nple-choice test. A benefit from underlining was observed \namong students who could earn the $5 bonus, but not among \nstudents in a control group. Thus, although results from this \nsingle study need to be replicated, it does appear that some \nstudents may have the ability to highlight effectively, but do \nnot always do so.\n4.2c Materials. Similar conclusions about marking text have \ncome from studies using a variety of different text materials on \ntopics as diverse as aerodynamics, ancient Greek schools, \naggression, and Tanzania, ranging in length from a few hun-\ndred words to a few thousand. Todd and Kessler (1971) \nmanipulated text length (all of the materials were relatively \nshort, with lengths of 44, 140, or 256 words) and found that \nunderlining was ineffective regardless of the text length. Fass \nand Schumacher (1978) manipulated whether a text about \nenzymes was easy or difficult to read; the easy version was at \na seventh-grade reading level, whereas the difficult version \nwas at high school level and contained longer sentences. A \nlarger difference between the highlighting and control groups \nwas found for performance on multiple-choice tests for the \ndifficult text as opposed to the easy text.\n4.2d Criterion tasks. A lack of benefit from highlighting has \nbeen observed on both immediate and delayed tests, with \ndelays ranging from 1 week to 1 month. A variety of depen-\ndent measures have been examined, including free recall, fac-\ntual multiple-choice questions, comprehension multiple-choice \nquestions, and sentence-completion tests.\nPerhaps most concerning are results from a study that sug-\ngested that underlining can be detrimental to later ability to \nmake inferences.

Peterson (1992) had education majors read \na 10,000-word chapter from a history textbook; two groups \nunderlined while studying for 90 minutes, whereas a third \ngroup was allowed only to read the chapter. One week later, \nall groups were permitted to review the material for 15 min-\nutes prior to taking a test on it (the two underlining groups \ndiffered in whether they reviewed a clean copy of the original \ntext or one containing their underlining). Everyone received \nthe same test again 2 months later, without having another \nchance to review the text. The multiple-choice test consisted \nof 20 items that probed facts (and could be linked to specific \nreferences in the text) and 20 items that required inferences \n(which would have to be based on connections across the text \nand could not be linked to specific, underlined information). \nThe three groups performed similarly on the factual ques-\ntions, but students who had underlined (and reviewed their \nmarked texts) were at a disadvantage on the inference ques-\ntions. This pattern of results requires replication and exten-\nsion, but one possible explanation for it is that standard \nunderlining draws attention more to individual concepts (sup-\nporting memory for facts) than to connections across con-\ncepts (as required by the inference questions). Consistent \nwith this idea, in another study, underliners who expected that \na final test would be in a multiple-choice format scored higher \non it than did underliners who expected it to be in a short-\nanswer format (Kulhavy, Dyer, & Silver, 1975), regardless of \nthe actual format of the final-test questions. Underlined infor-\nmation may naturally line up with the kinds of information \nstudents expect on multiple-choice tests (e.g., S. R. Schmidt, \n1988), but students may be less sure about what to underline \nwhen studying for a short-answer test.\n4.5 Effects in representative educational contexts. As \nalluded to at the beginning of this section, surveys of actual \ntextbooks and other student materials have supported the  \nfrequency of highlighting and underlining in educational  \ncontexts (e.g., Bell & Limber, 2010; Lonka et al., 1994). Less \nclear are the consequences of such real-world behaviors. \nClassroom studies have examined whether instructor-provided \nmarkings affect examination performance.

Exam scores on items related to the critical \nstatements were higher when the statements had been under-\nlined in red than when they had not. Interestingly, students in \nthe underlining condition also scored better on exam questions \nabout information that had been in sentences adjacent to the \ncritical statements (as opposed to scoring worse on questions \nabout nonunderlined information). The benefit to underlined \nitems was replicated in another psychology class (Leicht & \nCashen, 1972), although the effects were weaker. However, it \nis unclear whether the results from either of these studies \nwould generalize to a situation in which students were in \ncharge of their own highlighting, because they would likely \nmark many more than five statements in an article (and hence \nwould show less discrimination between important and trivial \ninformation).\n4.4 Issues for implementation. Students already are familiar \nwith and spontaneously adopt the technique of highlighting; \nthe problem is that the way the technique is typically imple-\nmented is not effective. Whereas the technique as it is typi-\ncally used is not normally detrimental to learning (but see \nPeterson, 1992, for a possible exception), it may be problem-\natic to the extent that it prevents students from engaging in \nother, more productive strategies.\nOne possibility that should be explored is whether students \ncould be trained to highlight more effectively. We located \nthree studies focused on training students to highlight. In two \nof these cases, training involved one or more sessions in which \nstudents practiced reading texts to look for main ideas before \nmarking any text. Students received feedback about practice \ntexts before marking (and being tested on) the target text, and \ntraining improved performance (e.g., Amer, 1994; Hayati & \nShariatifar, 2009). In the third case, students received feed-\nback on their ability to underline the most important content in \na text; critically, students were instructed to underline as little \nas possible. In one condition, students even lost points for \nunderlining extraneous material (Glover, Zimmer, Filbeck, & \nPlake, 1980). The training procedures in all three cases \ninvolved feedback, and they all had some safeguard against \noveruse of the technique. Given students\u2019 enthusiasm for high-\nlighting and underlining (or perhaps overenthusiasm, given \nthat students do not always use the technique correctly), dis-\ncovering fail-proof ways to ensure that this technique is used \neffectively might be easier than convincing students to aban-\ndon it entirely in favor of other techniques.\n4.5 Highlighting and underlining: Overall assessment. On \nthe basis of the available evidence, we rate highlighting and \nunderlining as having low utility. In most situations that have \nbeen examined and with most participants, highlighting does \nlittle to boost performance. It may help when students have the \nknowledge needed to highlight more effectively, or when texts \nare difficult, but it may actually hurt performance on higher-\nlevel tasks that require inference making. Future research \nshould be aimed at teaching students how to highlight effec-\ntively, given that students are likely to continue to use this \npopular technique despite its relative ineffectiveness.\n5 The keyword mnemonic\nDevelop a mental image of students hunched over textbooks, \nstruggling with a science unit on the solar system, trying to \nlearn the planets\u2019 names and their order in distance from the \nsun.

The earliest systematic research on \nimagery was begun in the late 1800s by Francis Galton (for a \nhistorical review, see Thompson, 1990); since then, many \ndebates have arisen about its nature (e.g., Kosslyn, 1981; Pyly-\nshyn, 1981), such as whether its power accrues from the stor-\nage of dual codes (one imaginal and one propositional) or the \nstorage of a distinctive propositional code (e.g., Marschark & \nHunt, 1989), and whether mental imagery is subserved by the \nsame brain mechanisms as visual imagery (e.g., Goldenberg, \n1998).\nFew of these debates have been entirely resolved, but fortu-\nnately, their resolution is not essential for capitalizing on the \npower of mental imagery. In particular, it is evident that the \nuse of imagery can enhance learning and comprehension for a \nwide variety of materials and for students with various abili-\nties. A review of this entire literature would likely go beyond a \nsingle monograph or perhaps even a book, given that mental \nimagery is one of the most highly investigated mental activi-\nties and has inspired enough empirical research to warrant its \nown publication (i.e., the Journal of Mental Imagery). Instead \nof an exhaustive review, we briefly discuss two specific uses \nof mental imagery for improving student learning that have \nbeen empirically scrutinized: the use of the keyword mne-\nmonic for learning foreign-language vocabulary, and the use \nof mental imagery for comprehending and learning text \nmaterials.\n5.1 General description of the keyword mnemonic and \nwhy it works. Imagine a student struggling to learn French \nvocabulary, including words such as la dent (tooth), la clef \n(key), revenir (to come back), and mourir (to die). To facilitate \nlearning, the student uses the keyword mnemonic, which is a \ntechnique based on interactive imagery that was developed by \nAtkinson and Raugh (1975). To use this mnemonic, the stu-\ndent would first find an English word that sounds similar to \nthe foreign cue word, such as dentist for \u201cla dent\u201d or cliff for", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3463, "end_char_idx": 6293, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce382f2e-b2b9-4b35-953f-a2e08fa1d11c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce382f2e-b2b9-4b35-953f-a2e08fa1d11c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd0f51d0-5a68-4b44-8b43-c61952b8abe8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "e6fd18b821a40279c1d8cc2419e8b29acfdeeb4c0a4ede1ca432c98cd0f1ccca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "79dbee16-1817-4fb0-984f-241a8a9f66fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8208532a97b0f0cd1c524f63d08835df48f520b954f95c2d6669cf8579b101ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "22  Dunlosky et al.\n\u201cla clef.\u201d The student would then develop a mental image of \nthe English keyword interacting with the English translation. \nSo, for la dent\u2013tooth, the student might imagine a dentist hold-\ning a large molar with a pair of pliers. Raugh and Atkinson \n(1975) had college students use the keyword mnemonic to \nlearn Spanish-English vocabulary (e.g., gusano\u2013worm): the \nstudents first learned to associate each experimenter-provided \nkeyword with the appropriate Spanish cue (e.g., \u201cgusano\u201d is \nassociated with the keyword \u201cgoose\u201d), and then they devel-\noped interactive images to associate the keywords with their \nEnglish translations. In a later test, the students were asked to \ngenerate the English translation when presented with the \nSpanish cue (e.g., \u201cgusano\u201d\u2013?). Students who used the key-\nword mnemonic performed significantly better on the test than \ndid a control group of students who studied the translation \nequivalents without keywords.\nBeyond this first demonstration, the potential benefits of \nthe keyword mnemonic have been extensively explored, and \nits power partly resides in the use of interactive images. In \nparticular, the interactive image involves elaboration that inte-\ngrates the words meaningfully, and the images themselves \nshould help to distinguish the sought-after translation from \nother candidates. For instance, in the example above, the \nimage of the \u201clarge molar\u201d distinguishes \u201ctooth\u201d (the target) \nfrom other candidates relevant to dentists (e.g., gums, drills, \nfloss). As we discuss next, the keyword mnemonic can be \neffectively used by students of different ages and abilities for \na variety of materials. Nevertheless, our analysis of this litera-\nture also uncovered limitations of the keyword mnemonic that \nmay constrain its utility for teachers and students. Given these \nlimitations, we did not separate our review of the literature \ninto separate sections that pertain to each variable category \n(Table 2) but instead provide a brief overview of the most rel-\nevant evidence concerning the generalizability of this \ntechnique.\n5.2 a\u2013d How general are the effects of the keyword mne-\nmonic? The benefits of the keyword mnemonic generalize to \nmany different kinds of material: (a) foreign-language vocabu-\nlary from a variety of languages (French, German, Italian, \nLatin, Russian, Spanish, and Tagalog); (b) the definitions of \nobscure English vocabulary words and science terms; (c) state-\ncapital associations (e.g., Lincoln is the capital of Nebraska); \n(d) medical terminology; (e) people\u2019s names and accomplish-\nments or occupations; and (f) minerals and their attributes (e.g., \nthe mineral wolframite is soft, dark in color, and used in the \nhome). Equally impressive, the keyword mnemonic has also \nbeen shown to benefit learners of different ages (from second \ngraders to college students) and students with learning disabili-\nties (for a review, see Jitendra, Edwards, Sacks, & Jacobson, \n2004). Although the bulk of research on the keyword mne-\nmonic has focused on students\u2019 retention of target materials, \nthe technique has also been shown to improve students\u2019 perfor-\nmance on a variety of transfer tasks: It helps them (a) to gener-\nate appropriate sentences using newly learned English \nvocabulary (McDaniel & Pressley, 1984) and (b) to adapt \nnewly acquired vocabulary to semantically novel contexts \n(Mastropieri, Scruggs, & Mushinski Fulk, 1990).\nThe overwhelming evidence that the keyword mnemonic \ncan boost memory for many kinds of material and learners has \nmade it a relatively popular technique. Despite the impressive \noutcomes, however, some aspects of these demonstrations \nimply limits to the utility of the keyword mnemonic. First, \nconsider the use of this technique for its originally intended \ndomain\u2014the learning of foreign-language vocabulary. In the \nexample above, la dent easily supports the development of a \nconcrete keyword (\u201cdentist\u201d) that can be easily imagined, \nwhereas many vocabulary terms are much less amenable to the \ndevelopment and use of keywords. In the case of revenir (to \ncome back), a student could perhaps use the keyword \n\u201crevenge\u201d (e.g., one might need \u201cto come back\u201d to taste its \nsweetness), but imaging this abstract term would be difficult \nand might even limit retention.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4309, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79dbee16-1817-4fb0-984f-241a8a9f66fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "79dbee16-1817-4fb0-984f-241a8a9f66fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd0f51d0-5a68-4b44-8b43-c61952b8abe8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "e6fd18b821a40279c1d8cc2419e8b29acfdeeb4c0a4ede1ca432c98cd0f1ccca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce382f2e-b2b9-4b35-953f-a2e08fa1d11c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "9e620dd94f7b141a3a96d3797ee4b1ee1c28c3a2c468751a61ea2e34b8b43e3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The overwhelming evidence that the keyword mnemonic \ncan boost memory for many kinds of material and learners has \nmade it a relatively popular technique.

Indeed, Hall (1988) found that \na control group (which received task practice but no specific \ninstructions on how to study) outperformed a keyword group \nin a test involving English definitions that did not easily afford \nkeyword generation, even when the keywords were provided. \nProponents of the keyword mnemonic do acknowledge that its \nbenefits may be limited to keyword-friendly materials (e.g., \nconcrete nouns), and in fact, the vast majority of the research \non the keyword mnemonic has involved materials that afforded \nits use.\nSecond, in most studies, the keywords have been provided \nby the experimenters, and in some cases, the interactive images \n(in the form of pictures) were provided as well. Few studies \nhave directly examined whether students can successfully \ngenerate their own keywords, and those that have have offered \nmixed results: Sometimes students\u2019 self-generated keywords \nfacilitate retention as well as experimenter-provided keywords \ndo (Shapiro & Waters, 2005), and sometimes they do not \n(Shriberg, Levin, McCormick, & Pressley, 1982; Thomas & \nWang, 1996). For more complex materials (e.g., targets with \nmultiple attributes, as in the wolframite example above), the \nexperimenter-provided \u201ckeywords\u201d were pictures, which \nsome students may have difficulties generating even after \nextensive training. Finally, young students who have difficul-\nties generating images appear to benefit from the keyword \nmnemonic only if keywords and an associated interactive \nimage (in the form of a picture) are supplied during learning \n(Pressley & Levin, 1978). Thus, although teachers who are \nwilling to construct appropriate keywords may find this mne-\nmonic useful, even these teachers (and students) would be able \nto use the technique only for subsets of target materials that are \nkeyword friendly.\nThird, and perhaps most disconcerting, the keyword mne-\nmonic may not produce durable retention. Some of the studies \ninvestigating the long-term benefits of the keyword mnemonic \nincluded a test soon after practice as well as one after a longer \ndelay of several days or even weeks (e.g., Condus, Marshall, \n& Miller, 1986; Raugh & Atkinson, 1975).

In particular, all items were tested \non both the immediate and delayed tests. Given that the key-\nword mnemonic yielded better performance on the immediate \ntests, this initial increase in successful recall could have \nboosted performance on the delayed tests and thus inappropri-\nately disadvantaged the control groups. Put differently, the \nadvantage in delayed test performance could have been largely \ndue to the effects of retrieval practice (i.e., from the immediate \ntest) and not to the use of keyword mnemonics per se (because \nretrieval can slow forgetting; see the Practice Testing section \nbelow).\nThis possibility was supported by data from Wang et al. \n(1992; see also Wang & Thomas, 1995), who administered \nimmediate and delayed tests to different groups of students. As \nshown in Figure 4 (top panel), for participants who received \nthe immediate test, the keyword-mnemonic group outper-\nformed a rote-repetition control group. By contrast, this bene-\nfit vanished for participants who received only the delayed \ntest. Even more telling, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure \n4, when the researchers equated the performance of the two \ngroups on the immediate test (by giving the rote-repetition \ngroup more practice), performance on the delayed test was \nsignificantly better for the rote-repetition group than for the \nkeyword-mnemonic group (Wang et al., 1992).\nThese data suggest that the keyword mnemonic leads to \naccelerated forgetting. One explanation for this surprising out-\ncome concerns decoding at retrieval: Students must decode \neach image to retrieve the appropriate target, and at longer \ndelays, such decoding may be particularly difficult. For \ninstance, when a student retrieves \u201ca dentist holding a large \nmolar with a pair of pliers,\u201d he or she may have difficulty \ndeciding whether the target is \u201cmolar,\u201d \u201ctooth,\u201d \u201cpliers,\u201d or \n\u201cenamel.\u201d\n5.3 Effects in representative educational contexts. The \nkeyword mnemonic has been implemented in classroom set-\ntings, and the outcomes have been mixed. On the promising \nside, Levin, Pressley, McCormick, Miller, and Shriberg (1979) \nhad fifth graders use the keyword mnemonic to learn Spanish \nvocabulary words that were keyword friendly. Students were \ntrained to use the mnemonic in small groups or as an entire \nclass, and in both cases, the groups who used the keyword \nmnemonic performed substantially better than did control \ngroups who were encouraged to use their own strategies while \nstudying. Less promising are results for high school students \nwho Levin et al. (1979) trained to use the keyword mnemonic. \nThese students were enrolled in a 1st-year or 2nd-year lan-\nguage course, which is exactly the context in which one would \nexpect the keyword mnemonic to help. However, the keyword \nmnemonic did not benefit recall, regardless of whether  \nstudents were trained individually or in groups. Likewise, \nWillerman and Melvin (1979) did not find benefits of \nkeyword-mnemonic training for college students enrolled in \nan elementary French course (cf. van Hell & Mahn, 1997; but \nsee Lawson & Hogben, 1998).\n5.4 Issues for implementation. The majority of research on \nthe keyword mnemonic has involved at least some (and occa-\nsionally extensive) training, largely aimed at helping students \ndevelop interactive images and use them to subsequently \nretrieve targets. Beyond training, implementation also requires \nthe development of keywords, whether by students, teachers, \nor textbook designers. The effort involved in generating some \nkeywords may not be the most efficient use of time for stu-\ndents (or teachers), particularly given that at least one easy- \nto-use technique (i.e., retrieval practice, Fritz, Morris, Acton, \nV oelkel, & Etkind, 2007) benefits retention as much as the \nkeyword mnemonic does.\n22\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nImmediate Test Delayed Test\nMean Number Recalled\nKeyword\nRote Repetition\nFig. 4.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4186, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65ff8b52-2b36-4b3f-890d-9c0614506eb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "65ff8b52-2b36-4b3f-890d-9c0614506eb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a540106f-adcc-428d-8241-d438e9212507", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "56a7b31528a89e57d0c9c1c2982356b3a26910c7db878ca39f74d4a0615749dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eff10c65-1013-4f60-b029-2bbc8270491b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "3708a5bc21f436af3dd03411b54010937837bb8a9e89c50f591ca29a43cdedc9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Beyond training, implementation also requires \nthe development of keywords, whether by students, teachers, \nor textbook designers.

Moreover, it is not \nclear that students will consistently benefit from the keyword \nmnemonic when they have to generate keywords; additional \nresearch is needed to more fully explore the effectiveness of \nkeyword generation (at all age levels) and whether doing so is \nan efficient use of students\u2019 time, as compared to other strate-\ngies. In one head-to-head comparison, cued recall of foreign-\nlanguage vocabulary was either no different after using the \nkeyword mnemonic (with experimenter-provided keywords) \nthan after practice testing, or was lower on delayed criterion \ntests 1 week later (Fritz, Morris, Acton, et al., 2007). Given \nthat practice testing is easier to use and more broadly applica-\nble (as reviewed below in the Practice Testing section), it \nseems superior to the keyword mnemonic.\n6 Imagery use for text learning\n6.1 General description of imagery use and why it should \nwork. In one demonstration of the potential of imagery for \nenhancing text learning, Leutner, Leopold, and Sumfleth \n(2009) gave tenth graders 35 minutes to read a lengthy science \ntext on the dipole character of water molecules. Students either \nwere told to read the text for comprehension (control group) or \nwere told to read the text and to mentally imagine the content \nof each paragraph using simple and clear mental images. \nImagery instructions were also crossed with drawing: Some \nstudents were instructed to draw pictures that represented the \ncontent of each paragraph, and others did not draw. Soon after \nreading, the students took a multiple-choice test that included \nquestions for which the correct answer was not directly avail-\nable from the text but needed to be inferred from it. As shown \nin Figure 5, the instructions to mentally imagine the content of \neach paragraph significantly boosted the comprehension-test \nperformance of students in the mental-imagery group, in com-\nparison to students in the control group (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.72). \nThis effect is impressive, especially given that (a) training was \nnot required, (b) the text involved complex science content, \nand (c) the criterion test required learners to make inferences \nabout the content. Finally, drawing did not improve compre-\nhension, and it actually negated the benefits of imagery \ninstructions. The potential for another activity to interfere with \nthe potency of imagery is discussed further in the subsection \non learning conditions (6.2a) below.\nA variety of mechanisms may contribute to the benefits of \nimaging text material on later test performance. Developing \nimages can enhance one\u2019s mental organization or integration \nof information in the text, and idiosyncratic images of particu-\nlar referents in the text could enhance learning as well (cf. dis-\ntinctive processing; Hunt, 2006). Moreover, using one\u2019s prior \nknowledge to generate a coherent representation of a narrative \nmay enhance a student\u2019s general understanding of the text; if \nso, the influence of imagery use may be robust across criterion \ntasks that tap memory and comprehension. Despite these pos-\nsibilities and the dramatic effect of imagery demonstrated by \nLeutner et al. (2009), our review of the literature suggests that \nthe effects of using mental imagery to learn from text may be \nrather limited and not robust.\n6.2 How general are the effects of imagery use for text \nlearning? Investigations of imagery use for learning text \nmaterials have focused on single sentences and longer text \nmaterials. Evidence concerning the impact of imagery on sen-\ntence learning largely comes from investigations of other mne-\nmonic techniques (e.g., elaborative interrogation) in which \nimagery instructions have been included in a comparison con-\ndition. This research has typically demonstrated that groups \nwho receive imagery instructions have better memory for sen-\ntences than do no-instruction control groups (e.g., R. C. \nAnderson & Hidde, 1971; Wood, Pressley, & Winne, 1990). In \nthe remainder of this section, we focus on the degree to which \nimagery instructions improve learning for longer text \nmaterials.\n6.2a Learning conditions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4529, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77bc9b1a-f5ad-4a76-b77b-0f18bac0291a": {"__data__": {"id_": "77bc9b1a-f5ad-4a76-b77b-0f18bac0291a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "373b98c3-de8c-4808-9709-a6f08d2a3ce8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "aae092860c5b1048661e9cc7cedaf402d787a791c21a66dc36724f9fa3909fdf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bec2ce0f-05e9-4ef1-bf4b-90f8756227c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "d6510405dbe58d65187d792cb8db6d59352608a9f5616b3f8b47b94b22228701", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "6.2 How general are the effects of imagery use for text \nlearning?

Thus, it is possible that the benefits \nof imagery are not fully actualized when students read text and \nwould be most evident if they listened. Two observations are \nrelevant to this possibility. First, the majority of imagery \nresearch has involved students reading texts; the fact that \nimagery benefits have sometimes been found indicates that \nreading does not entirely undermine imaginal processing. Sec-\nond, in experiments in which participants either read or lis-\ntened to a text, the results have been mixed. As expected, \nimagery has benefited performance more among students who \nhave listened to texts than among students who have read them \n(De Beni & Mo\u00e8, 2003; Levin & Divine-Hawkins, 1974), but \nin one case, imagery benefited performance similarly for both \nmodalities in a sample of fourth graders (Maher & Sullivan, \n1982).\nThe actual use of imagery as a learning technique should \nalso be considered when evaluating the imagery literature. In \nparticular, even if students are instructed to use imagery, they \nmay not necessarily use it. For instance, R. C. Anderson and \nKulhavy (1972) had high school seniors read a lengthy text \npassage about a fictitious primitive tribe; some students were \ntold to generate images while reading, whereas others were \ntold to read carefully. Imagery instructions did not influence \nperformance, but reported use of imagery was significantly \ncorrelated with performance (see also Denis, 1982). The prob-\nlem here is that some students who were instructed to use \nimagery did not, whereas some uninstructed students sponta-\nneously used it. Both circumstances would reduce the observed \neffect of imagery instructions, and students\u2019 spontaneous use \nof imagery in control conditions may be partly responsible for \nthe failure of imagery to benefit performance in some cases. \nUnfortunately, researchers have typically not measured imag-\nery use, so evaluation of these possibilities must await further \nresearch.\n6.2b Student characteristics. The efficacy of imagery instruc-\ntions have been evaluated across a wide range of student ages \nand abilities. Consider data from studies involving fourth \ngraders, given that this particular grade level has been popular \nin imagery research. In general, imagery instructions have \ntended to boost criterion performance for fourth graders, but \neven here the exceptions are noteworthy. For instance, imag-\nery instructions boosted the immediate test performance of \nfourth graders who studied short (e.g., 12-sentence) stories \nthat could be pictorially represented (e.g., Levin & Divine-\nHawkins, 1974), but in some studies, this benefit was found \nonly for students who were biased to use imagery or for skilled \nreaders (Levin, Divine-Hawkins, Kerst, & Guttman, 1974). \nFor reading longer narratives (e.g., narratives of 400 words or \nmore), imagery instructions have significantly benefited fourth \ngraders\u2019 free recall of text material (Gambrell & Jawitz, 1993; \nRasco, Tennyson, & Boutwell, 1975; see also Lesgold, McCor-\nmick, & Golinkoff, 1975) and performance on multiple-choice \nquestions about the text (Maher & Sullivan, 1982; this latter \nbenefit was apparent for both high- and low-skilled readers), \nbut even after extensive training and a reminder to use imag-\nery, fourth graders\u2019 performance on a standardized reading-\ncomprehension test did not improve (Lesgold et al., 1975).\nDespite the promise of imagery, this patchwork of inconsis-\ntent effects for fourth graders has also been found for students \nof other ages. College students have been shown to reap the \nbenefits of imagery, but these benefits depend on the nature of \nthe criterion test (an issue we discuss below). In two studies, \nhigh school students who read a long passage did not benefit \nfrom imagery instructions (R. C. Anderson & Kulhavy, 1972; \nRasco et al., 1975). Studies with fifth and sixth grade students \nhave shown some benefits of imagery, but these trends have \nnot all been significant (Kulhavy & Swenson, 1975) and did \nnot arise on some criterion tests (e.g., standardized achieve-\nment tests; Miccinati, 1982).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4371, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "145e7e05-8fe3-4271-8d6e-b0e29bcd29a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "145e7e05-8fe3-4271-8d6e-b0e29bcd29a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7cd9a075-994d-4602-97ad-ee051b66a56e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "4ab776732d663b48e233e7b9bd0ccb76c58f59d055e4d013f0d9e9ca3a1ee2a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4cfb8a1a-9b10-4d52-977e-41a6a6f1ced4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "8ab144467ed6b94e171a8b18b88243012b2ba7b46f37e02a8679d649afc61884", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Despite the promise of imagery, this patchwork of inconsis-\ntent effects for fourth graders has also been found for students \nof other ages.

Third graders have been shown \nto benefit from using imagery (Oakhill & Patel, 1991; Press-\nley, 1976), but younger students do not appear to benefit from \nattempting to generate mental images when listening to a story \n(Guttman, Levin, & Pressley, 1977).\n6.2c Materials. Similar to studies on the keyword mne-\nmonic, investigations of imagery use for text learning have \noften used texts that are imagery friendly, such as narratives \nthat can be visualized or short stories that include concrete \nterms. Across investigations, the specific texts have varied \nwidely and include long passages (of 2,000 words or more; \ne.g., R. C. Anderson & Kulhavy, 1972; Giesen & Peeck, 1984), \nrelatively short stories (e.g., L. K. S. Chan, Cole, & Morris, \n1990; Maher & Sullivan, 1982), and brief 10-sentence pas-\nsages (Levin & Divine-Hawkins, 1974; Levin et al., 1974). \nWith regard to these variations in materials, the safest conclu-\nsion is that sometimes imagery instructions boost performance \nand sometimes they do not. The literature is filled with interac-\ntions whereby imagery helped for one kind of material but not \nfor another kind of material. In these cases, failures to find an \neffect for any given kind of material may not be due to the \nmaterial per se, but instead may reflect the effect of other, \nuncontrolled factors, making it is impossible to tell which (if \nany) characteristics of the materials predict whether imagery \nwill be beneficial.\nFortunately, some investigators have manipulated the con-\ntent of text materials when examining the benefits of imagery \nuse. In De Beni and Mo\u00e8 (2003), one text included descrip-\ntions that were easy to imagine, another included a spatial \ndescription of a pathway that was easy to imagine and verbal-\nize, and another was abstract and presumably not easy to \nimagine. As compared with instructions to just rehearse the \ntexts, instructions to use imagery benefited free recall of the \neasy-to-imagine texts and the spatial texts but did not benefit \nrecall of the abstract texts. Moreover, the benefits were evi-\ndent only when students listened to the text, not when they \nread it (as discussed under \u201cLearning Conditions,\u201d 6.2a, \nabove).

Both studies used \nextensive training in the use of imagery while reading, and \nboth studies failed to find an effect of imagery training on test \nperformance (Lesgold, et al., 1975; Miccinati, 1982), even \nwhen participants were explicitly instructed to use their trained \nskills to complete the test (Lesgold et al., 1975).\n6.2d Criterion tasks. The inconsistent benefits of imagery \nwithin groups of students can in part be explained by interac-\ntions between imagery (vs. reading) instructions and the crite-\nrion task. Consider first the results from studies involving \ncollege students. When the criterion test comprises free-recall \nor short-answer questions tapping information explicitly stated \nin the text, college students tend to benefit from instructions to \nimage (e.g., Gyeselinck, Meneghetti, De Beni, & Pazzaglia, \n2009; Hodes, 1992; Rasco et al., 1975; although, as discussed \nearlier, these effects may be smaller when students read the \npassages rather than listen to them; De Beni & Mo\u00e8, 2003). By \ncontrast, despite the fact that imagery presumably helps stu-\ndents develop an integrated visual model of a text, imagery \ninstructions did not significantly help college students answer \nquestions that required them to make inferences based on \ninformation in a text (Giesen & Peeck, 1984) or comprehen-\nsion questions about a passage on the human heart (Hodes, \n1992).\nThis pattern is also apparent from studies with sixth grad-\ners, who do show significant benefits of imagery use on mea-\nsures involving the recall or summarization of text information \n(e.g., Kulhavy & Swenson, 1975), but show reduced or nonex-\nistent benefits on comprehension tests and on criterion tests \nthat require application of the knowledge (Gagne & Memory, \n1978; Miccinati, 1982). In general, imagery instructions tend \nnot to enhance students\u2019 understanding or application of the \ncontent of a text. One study demonstrated that training \nimproved 8- and 9-year-olds\u2019 performance on inference ques-\ntions, but in this case, training was extensive (three sessions), \nwhich may not be practical in some settings.\nWhen imagery instructions do improve criterion perfor -\nmance, a question arises as to whether these effects are long \nlasting. Unfortunately, the question of whether the use of \nimagery protects against the forgetting of text content has not \nbeen widely investigated; in the majority of studies, criterion \ntests have been administered immediately or shortly after the \ntarget material was studied. In one exception, Kulhavy and \nSwenson (1975) found that imagery instructions benefited \nfifth and sixth graders\u2019 accuracy in answering questions that \ntapped the gist of the texts, and this effect was even apparent 1 \nweek after the texts were initially read. The degree to which \nthese long-term benefits are robust and generalize across a \nvariety of criterion tasks is an open question.\n6.3 Effects in representative educational contexts. Many \nof the studies on imagery use and text learning have involved \nstudents from real classrooms who were reading texts that \nwere written to match the students\u2019 grade level.

The majority of studies have \nexamined the influence of imagery by using relatively brief \ninstructions that encouraged students to generate images of \ntext content while studying. Given that imagery does not \nappear to undermine learning (and that it does boost perfor-\nmance in some conditions), teachers may consider instructing \nstudents (third grade and above) to attempt to use imagery \nwhen they are reading texts that easily lend themselves to ima-\nginal representations. How much training would be required to \nensure that students consistently and effectively use imagery \nunder the appropriate conditions is unknown.\n6.5 Imagery use for learning text: Overall assessment. \nImagery can improve students\u2019 learning of text materials, and \nthe promising work by Leutner et al. (2009) speaks to the \npotential utility of imagery use for text learning. Imagery pro-\nduction is also more broadly applicable than the keyword \nmnemonic. Nevertheless, the benefits of imagery are largely \nconstrained to imagery-friendly materials and to tests of mem-\nory, and further demonstrations of the effectiveness of the \ntechnique (across different criterion tests and educationally \nrelevant retention intervals) are needed. Accordingly, we rated \nthe use of imagery for learning text as low utility.\n7 Rereading\nRereading is one of the techniques that students most fre-\nquently report using during self-regulated study (Carrier, \n2003; Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012; Karpicke, Butler, & Roedi-\nger, 2009; Kornell & Bjork, 2007; Wissman, Rawson, & Pyc, \n2012). For example, Carrier (2003) surveyed college students \nin an upper-division psychology course, and 65% reported \nusing rereading as a technique when preparing for course \nexams. More recent surveys have reported similar results. \nKornell and Bjork (2007) and Hartwig and Dunlosky (2012) \nasked students if they typically read a textbook, article, or", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3888, "end_char_idx": 6257, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3c3b0c9-e377-4d64-9175-c0c04a04ed85": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3c3b0c9-e377-4d64-9175-c0c04a04ed85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0209c31e-40fe-4cdd-84ce-3b4962068ca9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "cecbed8f9bdb399e6a236cfe2907abf684df6a625b5b0cadc2f12e34100ed235", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "77807bbb-9e25-42a3-8372-6d7b4c8530a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "92faaedb007a7eb52ba49bce2ef3ba5fc8fa2bd8e2bf9967d5be44d7b3ffc4e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Improving Student Achievement 27\nother source material more than once during study. Across \nthese two studies, 18% of students reported rereading entire \nchapters, and another 62% reported rereading parts or sections \nof the material. Even high-performing students appear to use \nrereading regularly. Karpicke et al. (2009) asked undergradu-\nates at an elite university (where students\u2019 average SAT scores \nwere above 1400) to list all of the techniques they used when \nstudying and then to rank them in terms of frequency of use. \nEighty-four percent of students included rereading textbook/\nnotes in their list, and rereading was also the top-ranked tech-\nnique (listed as the most frequently used technique by 55% of \nstudents). Students\u2019 heavy reliance on rereading during self-\nregulated study raises an important question: Is rereading an \neffective technique?\n7.1 General description of rereading and why it should \nwork. In an early study by Rothkopf (1968), undergraduates \nread an expository text (either a 1,500-word passage about \nmaking leather or a 750-word passage about Australian his-\ntory) zero, one, two, or four times. Reading was self-paced, \nand rereading was massed (i.e., each presentation of a text \noccurred immediately after the previous presentation). After  \na 10-minute delay, a cloze test was administered in which \n10% of the content words were deleted from the text and  \nstudents were to fill in the missing words. As shown in  \nFigure 6, performance improved as a function of number of \nreadings.\nWhy does rereading improve learning? Mayer (1983; Bro-\nmage & Mayer, 1986) outlined two basic accounts of reread-\ning effects. According to the quantitative hypothesis, rereading \nsimply increases the total amount of information encoded, \nregardless of the kind or level of information within the  \ntext. In contrast, the qualitative hypothesis assumes that \nrereading differentially affects the processing of higher-level \nand lower-level information within a text, with particular \nemphasis placed on the conceptual organization and process-\ning of main ideas during rereading. To evaluate these hypoth-\neses, several studies have examined free recall as a function of \nthe kind or level of text information. The results have been \nsomewhat mixed, but the evidence appears to favor the quali-\ntative hypothesis. Although a few studies found that rereading \nproduced similar improvements in the recall of main ideas and \nof details (a finding consistent with the quantitative hypothe-\nsis), several studies have reported greater improvement in the \nrecall of main ideas than in the recall of details (e.g., Bromage \n& Mayer, 1986; Kiewra, Mayer, Christensen, Kim, & Risch, \n1991; Rawson & Kintsch, 2005).\n7.2 How general are the effects of rereading?\n7.2a Learning conditions. Following the early work of Roth-\nkopf (1968), subsequent research established that the effects \nof rereading are fairly robust across other variations in learn-\ning conditions. For example, rereading effects obtain regard-\nless of whether learners are forewarned that they will be given \nthe opportunity to study more than once, although Barnett and \nSeefeldt (1989) found a small but significant increase in the \nmagnitude of the rereading effect among learners who were \nforewarned, relative to learners who were not forewarned. \nFurthermore, rereading effects obtain with both self-paced \nreading and experimenter-paced presentation. Although most \nstudies have involved the silent reading of written material, \neffects of repeated presentations have also been shown when \nlearners listen to an auditory presentation of text material (e.g., \nBromage & Mayer, 1986; Mayer, 1983).2\nOne aspect of the learning conditions that does significantly \nmoderate the effects of rereading concerns the lag between ini-\ntial reading and rereading. Although advantages of rereading \nover reading only once have been shown with massed reread-\ning and with spaced rereading (in which some amount of time \npasses or intervening material is presented between initial \nstudy and restudy), spaced rereading usually outperforms \nmassed rereading.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4139, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77807bbb-9e25-42a3-8372-6d7b4c8530a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "77807bbb-9e25-42a3-8372-6d7b4c8530a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0209c31e-40fe-4cdd-84ce-3b4962068ca9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "cecbed8f9bdb399e6a236cfe2907abf684df6a625b5b0cadc2f12e34100ed235", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3c3b0c9-e377-4d64-9175-c0c04a04ed85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "5d9c3237bbb54979b5353cd415d481f4e8478a04066ba20d3fcae9eb4d7d8074", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Furthermore, rereading effects obtain with both self-paced \nreading and experimenter-paced presentation.

Most of the benefits of rereading over a \nsingle reading appear to accrue from the second reading: The \nmajority of studies that have involved two levels of rereading \nhave shown diminishing returns from additional rereading tri-\nals. However, an important caveat is that all of these studies \ninvolved massed rereading. The extent to which additional \nspaced rereading trials produce meaningful gains in learning \nremains an open question.\nFinally, although learners in most experiments have studied \nonly one text, rereading effects have also been shown when \nlearners are asked to study several texts, providing suggestive \nevidence that rereading effects can withstand interference \nfrom other learning materials.\n7.2b Student characteristics. The extant literature is severely \nlimited with respect to establishing the generality of rereading \neffects across different groups of learners. To our knowledge, \nall but two studies of rereading effects have involved under-\ngraduate students. Concerning the two exceptions, Amlund, \nKardash, and Kulhavy (1986) reported rereading effects with \ngraduate students, and O\u2019Shea, Sindelar, and O\u2019Shea (1985) \nreported effects with third graders.\nThe extent to which rereading effects depend on knowledge \nlevel is also woefully underexplored. In the only study to date \nthat has provided any evidence about the extent to which \nknowledge may moderate rereading effects (Arnold, 1942), \nboth high-knowledge and low-knowledge readers showed an \nadvantage of massed rereading over outlining or summarizing \na passage for the same amount of time. Additional suggestive \nevidence that relevant background knowledge is not requisite \nfor rereading effects has come from three recent studies that \nused the same text (Rawson, 2012; Rawson & Kintsch, 2005; \nVerkoeijen et al., 2008) and found significant rereading effects \nfor learners with virtually no specific prior knowledge about \nthe main topics of the text (the charge of the Light Brigade in \nthe Crimean War and the Hollywood film portraying the event).\nSimilarly, few studies have examined rereading effects as a \nfunction of ability, and the available evidence is somewhat \nmixed. Arnold (1942) found an advantage of massed rereading \nover outlining or summarizing a passage for the same amount \nof time among learners with both higher and lower levels of \nintelligence and both higher and lower levels of reading ability \n(but see Callender & McDaniel, 2009, who did not find an \neffect of massed rereading over single reading for either \nhigher- or lower-ability readers). Raney (1993) reported a sim-\nilar advantage of massed rereading over a single reading for \nreaders with either higher or lower working-memory spans. \nFinally, Barnett and Seefeldt (1989) defined high- and low-\nability groups by a median split of ACT scores; both groups \nshowed an advantage of massed rereading over a single read-\ning for short-answer factual questions, but only high-ability \nlearners showed an effect for questions that required applica-\ntion of the information.\n7.2c Materials. Rereading effects are robust across varia-\ntions in the length and content of text material. Although most \nstudies have used expository texts, rereading effects have also \nbeen shown for narratives. Those studies involving expository \ntext material have used passages of considerably varying \nlengths, including short passages (e.g., 99\u2013125 words), inter-\nmediate passages (e.g., 390\u2013750 words), lengthy passages \n(e.g., 900\u20131,500 words), and textbook chapters or magazine \narticles with several thousand words. Additionally, a broad \nrange of content domains and topics have been covered\u2014an \nillustrative but nonexhaustive list includes physics (e.g., \nOhm\u2019s law), law (e.g., legal principles of evidence), history \n(e.g., the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge), technology \n(e.g., how a camera exposure meter works), biology (e.g., \ninsects), geography (e.g., of Africa), and psychology (e.g., the \ntreatment of mental disorders).\n7.2d Criterion tasks.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4259, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc0efdd4-3a6d-4694-a036-3938407a7e76": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc0efdd4-3a6d-4694-a036-3938407a7e76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d44cbc16-92e8-43af-a8e0-96f2ce76d977", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "b61f360726f1b8567e12289cffcd66ee744a8c1e055d9e3c56e0a2633886f6c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd1246ca-1cee-4ed8-84b6-913d1b62a99c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "83ced5847001624913c2d53b716789d157f6b516f6023863b10830473339cbd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Those studies involving expository \ntext material have used passages of considerably varying \nlengths, including short passages (e.g., 99\u2013125 words), inter-\nmediate passages (e.g., 390\u2013750 words), lengthy passages \n(e.g., 900\u20131,500 words), and textbook chapters or magazine \narticles with several thousand words.

In contrast, the effects of rereading on recogni-\ntion are less certain, with weak or nonexistent effects on sen-\ntence-verification tasks and multiple-choice questions tapping \ninformation explicitly stated in the text (Callender & McDan-\niel, 2009; Dunlosky & Rawson, 2005; Hinze & Wiley, 2011; \nKardash & Scholes, 1995). The evidence concerning the \neffects of rereading on comprehension is somewhat muddy. \nAlthough some studies have shown positive effects of reread-\ning on answering problem-solving essay questions (Mayer, \n1983) and short-answer application or inference questions \n(Karpicke & Blunt, 2011; Rawson & Kintsch, 2005), other \nstudies using application or inference-based questions have \nreported effects only for higher-ability students (Barnett & \nSeefeldt, 1989) or no effects at all (Callender & McDaniel, \n2009; Dunlosky & Rawson, 2005; Durguno\u011flu, Mir, & Ari\u00f1o-\nMart\u00ed, 1993; Griffin, Wiley, & Thiede, 2008).\nConcerning the durability of learning, most of the studies \nthat have shown significant rereading effects have adminis-\ntered criterion tests within a few minutes after the final study \ntrial, and most of these studies reported an advantage of \nmassed rereading over a single reading. The effects of massed \nrereading after longer delays are somewhat mixed. Agarwal, \nKarpicke, Kang, Roediger, and McDermott (2008; see also \nKarpicke & Blunt, 2011) reported massed rereading effects \nafter 1 week, but other studies have failed to find significant \neffects after 1\u20132 days (Callender & McDaniel, 2009; Cranney, \nAhn, McKinnon, Morris, & Watts, 2009; Hinze & Wiley, \n2011; Rawson & Kintsch, 2005).\nFewer studies have involved spaced rereading, although a \nrelatively consistent advantage for spaced rereading over a \nsingle reading has been shown both on immediate tests and on \ntests administered after a 2-day delay.

A \nsimilar number of studies have shown an advantage of spacing \nover massing, an advantage of massing over spacing, and no \ndifferences in performance. In contrast, spaced rereading con-\nsistently outperforms massed rereading on delayed tests. We \nexplore the benefits of spacing more generally in the Distrib-\nuted Practice section below.\n7.3 Effects in representative educational contexts. Given \nthat rereading is the study technique that students most com-\nmonly report using, it is perhaps ironic that no experimental \nresearch has assessed its impact on learning in educational \ncontexts. Although many of the topics of the expository texts \nused in rereading research are arguably similar to those that \nstudents might encounter in a course, none of the aforemen-\ntioned studies have involved materials taken from actual \ncourse content. Furthermore, none of the studies were admin-\nistered in the context of a course, nor have any of the outcome \nmeasures involved course-related tests. The only available \nevidence involves correlational findings reported in survey \nstudies, and it is mixed. Carrier (2003) found a nonsignificant \nnegative association between self-reported rereading of text-\nbook chapters and exam performance but a significantly posi-\ntive association between self-reported review of lecture notes \nand exam performance. Hartwig and Dunlosky (2012) found a \nsmall but significant positive association between self-reported \nrereading of textbook chapters or notes and self-reported grade \npoint average, even after controlling for self-reported use of \nother techniques.\n7.4 Issues for implementation. One advantage of rereading \nis that students require no training to use it, other than perhaps \nbeing instructed that rereading is generally most effective \nwhen completed after a moderate delay rather than immedi-\nately after an initial reading. Additionally, relative to some \nother learning techniques, rereading is relatively economical \nwith respect to time demands (e.g., in those studies permitting \nself-paced study, the amount of time spent rereading has typi-\ncally been less than the amount of time spent during initial \nreading). However, in head-to-head comparisons of learning \ntechniques, rereading has not fared well against some of the \nmore effective techniques discussed here. For example, direct \ncomparisons of rereading to elaborative interrogation, self-\nexplanation, and practice testing (described in the Practice \nTesting section below) have consistently shown rereading to \nbe an inferior technique for promoting learning.\n7.5 Rereading: Overall assessment. Based on the available \nevidence, we rate rereading as having low utility. Although \nbenefits from rereading have been shown across a relatively \nwide range of text materials, the generality of rereading effects \nacross the other categories of variables in Table 2 has not been \nwell established. Almost no research on rereading has involved \nlearners younger than college-age students, and an insufficient \namount of research has systematically examined the extent to \nwhich rereading effects depend on other student characteris-\ntics, such as knowledge or ability. Concerning criterion tasks, \nthe effects of rereading do appear to be durable across at least \nmodest delays when rereading is spaced. However, most \neffects have been shown with recall-based memory measures, \nwhereas the benefit for comprehension is less clear. Finally, \nalthough rereading is relatively economical with respect to \ntime demands and training requirements when compared with \nsome other learning techniques, rereading is also typically \nmuch less effective. The relative disadvantage of rereading to \nother techniques is the largest strike against rereading and is \nthe factor that weighed most heavily in our decision to assign \nit a rating of low utility.\n8 Practice testing\nTesting is likely viewed by many students as an undesirable \nnecessity of education, and we suspect that most students \nwould prefer to take as few tests as possible. This view of test-\ning is understandable, given that most students\u2019 experience \nwith testing involves high-stakes summative assessments that \nare administered to evaluate learning. This view of testing is \nalso unfortunate, because it overshadows the fact that testing \nalso improves learning. Since the seminal study by Abbott \n(1909), more than 100 years of research has yielded several \nhundred experiments showing that practice testing enhances \nlearning and retention (for recent reviews, see Rawson & Dun-\nlosky, 2011; Roediger & Butler, 2011; Roediger, Putnam, & \nSmith, 2011).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4720, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92304575-de9f-4c4e-bf1f-9afcca053d54": {"__data__": {"id_": "92304575-de9f-4c4e-bf1f-9afcca053d54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f606b326-e855-4910-b634-6e66113db6f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "4a1ba4c99228c370c3f37e73a27f4dd868869f0b314101b65ef82386f38912be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4117338b-d8b1-4765-a679-5cb7354bc5f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "c7093c26dd63d5273f1088b2ac791ec092bbf6f2419d3cef61d8431af4077220", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "8 Practice testing\nTesting is likely viewed by many students as an undesirable \nnecessity of education, and we suspect that most students \nwould prefer to take as few tests as possible.

Whereas this study \nillustrates the method of comparing performance between \nconditions that do and do not involve a practice test, many \nother studies have compared a practice-testing condition with \nmore stringent conditions involving additional presentations \nof the to-be-learned information. For example, Roediger and \nKarpicke (2006b) presented undergraduates with a short \nexpository text for initial study followed either by a second \nstudy trial or by a practice free-recall test. One week later, free \nrecall was considerably better among the group that had taken \nthe practice test than among the group that had restudied (56% \nversus 42%). As another particularly compelling demonstra-\ntion of the potency of testing as compared with restudy, Kar-\npicke and Roediger (2008) presented undergraduates with \nSwahili-English translations for cycles of study and practice \ncued recall until items were correctly recalled once. After the \nfirst correct recall, items were presented only in subsequent \nstudy cycles with no further testing, or only in subsequent test \ncycles with no further study. Performance on a final test 1 \nweek later was substantially greater after continued testing \n(80%) than after continued study (36%).\nWhy does practice testing improve learning? Whereas a \nwealth of studies have established the generality of testing \neffects, theories about why it improves learning have lagged \nbehind. Nonetheless, theoretical accounts are increasingly \nemerging to explain two different kinds of testing effects, \nwhich are referred to as direct effects and mediated effects of \ntesting (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). Direct effects refer to \nchanges in learning that arise from the act of taking a test \nitself, whereas mediated effects refer to changes in learning \nthat arise from an influence of testing on the amount or kind of \nencoding that takes place after the test (e.g., during a subse-\nquent restudy opportunity).\nConcerning direct effects of practice testing, Carpenter \n(2009) recently proposed that testing can enhance retention by \ntriggering elaborative retrieval processes. Attempting to \nretrieve target information involves a search of long-term \nmemory that activates related information, and this activated \ninformation may then be encoded along with the retrieved tar-\nget, forming an elaborated trace that affords multiple path-\nways to facilitate later access to that information. In support of \nthis account, Carpenter (2011) had learners study weakly \nrelated word pairs (e.g., \u201cmother\u201d\u2013\u201cchild\u201d) followed either by \nadditional study or a practice cued-recall test. On a later final \ntest, recall of the target word was prompted via a previously \nunpresented but strongly related word (e.g., \u201cfather\u201d). Perfor-\nmance was greater following a practice test than following \nrestudy, presumably because the practice test increased the \nlikelihood that the related information was activated and \nencoded along with the target during learning.\nConcerning mediated effects of practice testing, Pyc and \nRawson (2010, 2012b) proposed a similar account, according \nto which practice testing facilitates the encoding of more \neffective mediators (i.e., elaborative information connecting \ncues and targets) during subsequent restudy opportunities. Pyc \nand Rawson (2010) presented learners with Swahili-English \ntranslations in an initial study block, which was followed by \nthree blocks of restudy trials; for half of the participants, each \nrestudy trial was preceded by practice cued recall. All learners \nwere prompted to generate and report a keyword mediator dur-\ning each restudy trial. When tested 1 week later, compared \nwith students who had only restudied, students who had \nengaged in practice cued recall were more likely to recall their \nmediators when prompted with the cue word and were more \nlikely to recall the target when prompted with their mediator.\nRecent evidence also suggests that practice testing may \nenhance how well students mentally organize information and \nhow well they process idiosyncratic aspects of individual \nitems, which together can support better retention and test per-\nformance (Hunt, 1995, 2006). Zaromb and Roediger (2010) \npresented learners with lists consisting of words from different \ntaxonomic categories (e.g., vegetables, clothing) either for \neight blocks of study trials or for four blocks of study trials \nwith each trial followed by a practice free-recall test.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4519, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "078c232b-9c3d-42a9-8bf6-581ef9af1ca4": {"__data__": {"id_": "078c232b-9c3d-42a9-8bf6-581ef9af1ca4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85291055-3660-49cb-965b-3c6b9d8ecad3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "7a0bd85ebdf330db73c90b1f7a522fc7ea9512b10614758357c4ad9a63e523c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff6fac74-fb57-418e-87fd-f4d0bc1a5901", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "d20c9e262148adf2e59c6c5483f1c3b07fcc9938f8908ee5f433a31373157f03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "When tested 1 week later, compared \nwith students who had only restudied, students who had \nengaged in practice cued recall were more likely to recall their \nmediators when prompted with the cue word and were more \nlikely to recall the target when prompted with their mediator.\nRecent evidence also suggests that practice testing may \nenhance how well students mentally organize information and \nhow well they process idiosyncratic aspects of individual \nitems, which together can support better retention and test per-\nformance (Hunt, 1995, 2006).

Given \nthe volume of research on testing effects, an exhaustive review \nof the literature is beyond the scope of this article. Accord-\ningly, our synthesis below is primarily based on studies from \nthe past 10 years (which include more than 120 articles), \nwhich we believe represent the current state of the field. Most \nof these studies compared conditions involving practice tests \nwith conditions not involving practice tests or involving only \nrestudy; however, we also considered more recent work pitting \ndifferent practice-testing conditions against one another to \nexplore when practice testing works best.\n8.2a Learning conditions. The majority of research on prac-\ntice testing has used test formats that involve cued recall of \ntarget information from memory, but some studies have also \nshown testing effects with other recall-based practice-test for-\nmats, including free recall, short-answer questions, and fill-  \nin-the-blank questions. A growing number of studies using \nmultiple-choice practice tests have also reported testing effects. \nAcross these formats, most prior research has involved prac-\ntice tests that tap memory for explicitly presented information. \nHowever, several studies have also shown testing effects for \npractice tests that tap comprehension, including short-answer \napplication and multiple-choice inference-based questions \n(e.g., Agarwal & Roediger, 2011; Butler, 2010; C. I. Johnson & \nMayer, 2009). Testing effects have also been shown in a study \nin which practice involved predicting (vs. studying) input-out-\nput values in an inductive function learning task (Kang, \nMcDaniel, & Pashler, 2011) and a study in which participants \npracticed (vs. restudied) resuscitation procedures (Kromann,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3693, "end_char_idx": 6663, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0153b158-06e0-46de-a77c-31182c160425": {"__data__": {"id_": "0153b158-06e0-46de-a77c-31182c160425", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83bac386-f490-403a-bab7-a8d8a46c6a74", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "7d69ebf392e751b874863c1b86fbfd2dcec7eca40f2b6ca9274b7f9c809e733a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "efa8a70a-c037-46e4-ad2c-af5e5a42cae9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7337417c13c7e605cb80ec5513d48041eb81fd94175c9c63838711f4cee5c68d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Improving Student Achievement 31\nJensen, & Ringsted, 2009). Some research has demonstrated \ntesting effects even when practice tests are open book (Agar -\nwal et al., 2008; Weinstein, McDermott, & Roediger, 2010).\nIt is important to note that practice tests can benefit learn-\ning even when the format of the practice test does not match \nthe format of the criterion test. For example, research has \nshown cross-format effects of multiple-choice practice tests \non subsequent cued recall (Fazio, Agarwal, Marsh, & Roedi-\nger, 2010; Marsh, Agarwal, & Roediger, 2009; Roediger & \nMarsh, 2005), practice free recall on subsequent multiple-\nchoice and short-answer inference tests (McDaniel, Howard, \n& Einstein, 2009), and practice cued recall on subsequent free \nrecall and recognition (Carpenter, Pashler, & Vul, 2006; \nVaughn & Rawson, 2011).\nAlthough various practice-test formats work, some work \nbetter than others. Glover (1989) presented students with a \nshort expository text for initial study and then manipulated the \nformat of the practice test (free recall, fill in the blank, or rec-\nognition) and the format of the final test (free recall, fill in the \nblank, or recognition). On all three final-test formats, perfor-\nmance was greater following free-recall practice than follow-\ning fill-in-the-blank practice, which in turn was greater than \nperformance following recognition practice. Similarly, Carpen-\nter and DeLosh (2006) found that free-recall practice outper-\nformed cued-recall and recognition practice regardless of \nwhether the final test was in a free-recall, cued-recall, or recog-\nnition format, and Hinze and Wiley (2011) found that perfor-\nmance on a multiple-choice final test was better following cued \nrecall of paragraphs than following fill-in-the-blank practice. \nFurther work is needed to support strong prescriptive conclu-\nsions, but the available evidence suggests that practice tests \nthat require more generative responses (e.g., recall or short \nanswer) are more effective than practice tests that require less \ngenerative responses (e.g., fill in the blank or recognition).\nIn addition to practice-test format, two other conditions of \nlearning that strongly influence the benefits of practice testing \nare dosage and timing. Concerning dosage, the simplest con-\nclusion is that more is better. Some studies supporting this con-\nclusion have manipulated the number of practice tests, and \nfinal-test performance has consistently been better following \nmultiple practice tests than following a single practice test \n(e.g., Karpicke & Roediger, 2007a, 2010; Logan & Balota, \n2008; Pavlik & Anderson, 2005). In other studies, experiment-\ners have varied the number of practice tests to manipulate the \nlevel of success achieved during practice. For example, Vaughn \nand Rawson (2011) observed significantly greater final-test \nperformance when students engaged in cued-recall practice \nuntil target items were recalled four to five times versus only \nonce. Several other studies have shown that final-test perfor-\nmance improves as the number of correct responses during \npractice increases (e.g., Karpicke & Roediger, 2007b, 2008; \nPyc & Rawson, 2009, 2012a; Rawson & Dunlosky, 2011), \nalbeit with diminishing returns as higher criterion levels are \nachieved. Whereas these studies have involved manipulations \nof dosage within a practice session, other studies that have \nmanipulated the number of practice sessions have also found \nthat more is better (Bahrick, 1979; Bahrick, Bahrick, Bahrick, \n& Bahrick, 1993; Morris & Fritz, 2002; Rawson & Dunlosky, \n2011).\nHowever, the benefit of repeated practice testing in turn \ndepends on the timing of the practice tests. Several studies \nhave increased the number of tests presented in immediate \nsuccession within a session and have found minimal or nonex-\nistent effects, in contrast to the sizable benefits observed when \nrepeated tests are spaced (e.g., Carpenter & DeLosh, 2005; \nCull, 2000; Glover, 1989; Karpicke & Bauernschmidt, 2011). \nConcerning the time intervals involved with spacing, longer is \nbetter.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4104, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efa8a70a-c037-46e4-ad2c-af5e5a42cae9": {"__data__": {"id_": "efa8a70a-c037-46e4-ad2c-af5e5a42cae9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83bac386-f490-403a-bab7-a8d8a46c6a74", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "7d69ebf392e751b874863c1b86fbfd2dcec7eca40f2b6ca9274b7f9c809e733a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0153b158-06e0-46de-a77c-31182c160425", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "899ecccc96c63824b1ac008efbebd3aaf0d02b755264f6ead99120da6156f9b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "However, the benefit of repeated practice testing in turn \ndepends on the timing of the practice tests.

We discuss lag effects fur-\nther in the Distributed Practice section below.\n8.2b Student characteristics. A large majority of studies have \ninvolved college students as participants, but testing effects \nhave also been demonstrated across participants of widely \nvarying ages. Studies involving nonundergraduate samples \nhave differed somewhat in the kind, dosage, or timing of prac-\ntice testing involved, but some form of testing effect has been \ndemonstrated with preschoolers and kindergartners (Fritz, \nMorris, Nolan, & Singleton, 2007; Kratochwill, Demuth, & \nConzemius, 1977), elementary school students (Atkinson & \nPaulson, 1972; Bouwmeester & Verkoeijen, 2011; Fishman, \nKeller, & Atkinson, 1968; Gates, 1917; Metcalfe & Kornell, \n2007; Metcalfe, Kornell, & Finn, 2009; Myers, 1914; Rea & \nModigliani, 1985; Rohrer, Taylor, & Sholar, 2010; Spitzer, \n1939), middle school students (Carpenter et al., 2009; Fritz, \nMorris, Nolan, et al., 2007; Glover, 1989; McDaniel, Agarwal, \nHuelser, McDermott, & Roediger, 2011; Metcalfe, Kornell, & \nSon, 2007; Sones & Stroud, 1940), high school students \n(Duchastel, 1981; Duchastel & Nungester, 1982; Marsh et al., \n2009; Nungester & Duchastel, 1982), and more advanced stu-\ndents, such as 3rd- and 4th-year medical-school students (Kro-\nmann et al., 2009; Rees, 1986; Schmidmaier et al., 2011). On \nthe other end of the continuum, testing effects have also been \nshown with middle-aged learners and with older adults \n(Balota, Duchek, Sergent-Marshall, & Roediger, 2006; Bis-\nhara & Jacoby, 2008; Logan & Balota, 2008; Maddox, Balota, \nCoane, & Duchek, 2011; Sumowski, Chiaravalloti, & DeLuca, \n2010; Tse, Balota, & Roediger, 2010).\nIn contrast to the relatively broad range of ages covered in \nthe testing-effect literature, surprisingly minimal research has \nexamined testing effects as a function of individual differences", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3605, "end_char_idx": 6682, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9a53fb2-bda5-4e3a-a23b-7efcc471dc64": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9a53fb2-bda5-4e3a-a23b-7efcc471dc64", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df6f44fc-cc34-42fb-880f-77692f4d1d96", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "d43efb5bd438c567b9772c5137e11c10fe57edc3393d389bed9c470723306611", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "32  Dunlosky et al.\nin knowledge or ability. In the only study including groups of \nlearners with different knowledge levels, Carroll, Campbell-\nRatcliffe, Murnane, and Perfect (2007) presented first-year \nundergraduates and advanced psychology majors with two \npassages from an abnormal-psychology textbook. Students \ncompleted a short-answer practice test on one of the passages \nand then took a final test over both passages either 15 minutes \nor 1 day later. Both groups showed similar testing effects at \nboth time points (with 33% and 38% better accuracy, respec-\ntively, on the material that had been practice tested relative to \nthe material that had not). Although these initial results pro-\nvide encouraging evidence that testing effects may be robust \nacross knowledge levels, further work is needed before strong \nconclusions can be drawn about the extent to which knowl-\nedge level moderates testing effects.\nLikewise, minimal research has examined testing effects as \na function of academically relevant ability levels. In a study by \nSpitzer (1939), 3,605 sixth graders from 91 different elemen-\ntary schools read a short text and took an immediate test, to \nprovide a baseline measure of reading comprehension ability. \nIn the groups of interest here, all students read an experimental \ntext, half completed a practice multiple-choice test, and then \nall completed a multiple-choice test either 1 or 7 days later. \nSpitzer reported final-test performance for the experimental \ntext separately for the top and bottom thirds of performers on \nthe baseline measure. As shown in Figure 7, taking the practice \ntest benefited both groups of students. With that said, the testing \neffect appeared to be somewhat larger for higher-ability readers \nthan for lower-ability readers (with approximately 20%, vs. \n12%, improvements in accuracy), although Spitzer did not \nreport the relevant inferential statistics.\nFinally, evidence from studies involving patient popula-\ntions is at least suggestive with respect to the generality of \ntesting effects across different levels of learning capacity. For \nexample, Balota et al. (2006) found that spaced practice tests \nimproved retention over short time intervals not only for \nyounger adults and healthy older adults but also for older \nadults with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Similarly, Sumowski et al. \n(2010) found that a practice test produced larger testing effects \nfor memory-impaired, versus memory-intact, subsets of mid-\ndle-aged individuals with multiple sclerosis (d = 0.95 vs. d = \n0.54, respectively, with grouping based on performance on a \nbaseline measure of memory). In sum, several studies have \nsuggested that practice testing may benefit individuals with \nvarying levels of knowledge or ability, but the extent to which \nthe magnitude of the benefit depends on these factors remains \nan open question.\n8.2c Materials. Many of the studies that have demonstrated \ntesting effects have involved relatively simple verbal materi-\nals, including word lists and paired associates. However, most \nof the sets of materials used have had some educational rele-\nvance. A sizable majority of studies using paired-associate \nmaterials have included foreign-language translations (includ-\ning Chinese, I\u00f1upiaq, Japanese, Lithuanian, Spanish, and \nSwahili) or vocabulary words paired with synonyms. Other \nstudies have extended effects to paired book titles and author \nnames, names and faces, objects and names, and pictures and \nforeign-language translations (e.g., Barcroft, 2007; Carpenter \n& Vul, 2011; Morris & Fritz, 2002; Rohrer, 2009).\nA considerable number of studies have also shown testing \neffects for factual information, including trivia facts and gen-\neral knowledge questions (e.g., Butler, Karpicke, & Roediger, \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nDay Delay Week Delay Day Delay Week Delay\nTop Third on\nBaseline Measure\nBottom Third on\nBaseline Measure\nFinal-Test Performance (%)\nPractice Test\nNo Practice Test\nFig. 7.

Earlier research showed that practice \ntests helped children learn multiplication facts and spelling \nlists (Atkinson & Paulson, 1972; Fishman et al., 1968; Rea & \nModigliani, 1985), and recent studies have reported enhanced \nlearning of definitions of vocabulary words (Metcalfe et al., \n2007) and definitions of key term concepts from classroom \nmaterial (Rawson & Dunlosky, 2011).\nAn increasing number of studies have shown benefits for \nlearning from text materials of various lengths (from 160 \nwords to 2,000 words or more), of various text genres (e.g., \nencyclopedia entries, scientific journal articles, textbook pas-\nsages), and on a wide range of topics (e.g., Civil War econom-\nics, bat echolocation, sea otters, the big bang theory, fossils, \nArctic exploration, toucans). Practice tests have improved \nlearning from video lectures and from narrated animations on \ntopics such as adult development, lightning, neuroanatomy, \nand art history (Butler & Roediger, 2007; Cranney et al., 2009; \nV ojdanoska, Cranney, & Newell, 2010).\nAlthough much of the work on testing effects has used ver-\nbal materials, practice testing has also been shown to support \nlearning of materials that include visual or spatial information, \nincluding learning of features and locations on maps (Carpen-\nter & Pashler, 2007; Rohrer et al., 2010), identifying birds \n(Jacoby, Wahlheim, & Coane, 2010), naming objects (Cepeda \net al., 2009; Fritz et al., 2007), associating names with faces \n(Helder & Shaughnessy, 2008; Morris & Fritz, 2002), learning \nspatial locations of objects (Sommer, Schoell, & B\u00fcchel, \n2008), learning symbols (Coppens, Verkoeijen, & Rikers, \n2011), and identifying depicted parts of a flower (Glover, \n1989). Finally, recent work has extended testing effects to \nnondeclarative learning, including the learning of resuscita-\ntion skills (Kromann et al., 2009) and inductive learning of \ninput-output functions (Kang, McDaniel, et al., 2011).\n8.2d Criterion tasks. Although cued recall is the most com-\nmonly used criterion measure, testing effects have also been \nshown with other forms of memory tests, including free-recall, \nrecognition, and fill-in-the-blank tests, as well as short-answer \nand multiple-choice questions that tap memory for informa-\ntion explicitly stated in text material.\nRegarding transfer, the modal method in testing-effect \nresearch has involved using the same questions tapping the \nsame target information (e.g., the same cued-recall prompts or \nmultiple-choice questions) on practice tests and criterion tests. \nHowever, as described in the subsection on learning condi-\ntions (8.2a) above, many studies have also shown testing \neffects when learning of the same target information is evalu-\nated using different test formats for practice and criterion tests. \nFurthermore, an increasing number of studies have shown that \npractice testing a subset of information influences memory for \nrelated but untested information (J.

Positive \neffects have been shown on criterion tests that require infer-\nences or the application of previously learned information \n(Agarwal & Roediger, 2011; Butler, 2010; Foos & Fisher, \n1988; C.

In fact, concept-mapping performance was better follow-\ning free-recall practice during study than following concept \nmapping during study. Similarly, Butler (2010) presented stu-\ndents with expository texts for initial study, which was fol-\nlowed either by repeated restudy or by repeated practice \nshort-answer tests (with feedback) tapping key facts and con-\ncepts from the texts. One week later, performance on new \ninference-based short-answer questions tapping the key facts \nand concepts was better following practice testing than fol-\nlowing restudy (see Fig. 8). The outcomes of a follow-up \nexperiment are particularly striking, given that the criterion \ntest involved far transfer, in that questions required the con-\ncepts from one domain to be applied in a novel domain (e.g., \nstudents had to apply information learned about bat wings to \nmake inferences about the development of new kinds of \naircraft).\nFinally, recent studies have also shown testing effects \ninvolving other forms of transfer.

The subsequent criterion test involved the \nsame families of birds but included new pictures of birds from \nthose families. Learners were more accurate in classifying \nnew birds following practice testing than following restudy \nonly. Similarly, Kang, McDaniel, & Pashler (2011) examined \ninductive function learning under conditions in which learners \neither studied pairs of input-output values or predicted output \nfor a given input value prior to being shown the correct output. \nThe prediction group outperformed the study-only group on a \ncriterion test for both trained pairs and untrained extrapolation \npairs.\nIn addition to establishing testing effects across an array of \noutcome measures, studies have also demonstrated testing \neffects across many retention intervals. Indeed, in contrast to \nliteratures on other learning techniques, contemporary research \non testing effects has actually used short retention intervals \nless often than longer retention intervals. Although a fair num-\nber of studies have shown testing effects after short delays \n(0\u201320 minutes), the sizable majority of recent research has \ninvolved delays of at least 1 day, and the modal retention inter-\nval used is 1 week. The preference for using longer retention \nintervals may be due in part to outcomes from several studies \nreporting that testing effects are larger when final tests are \nadministered after longer delays (J. C. K. Chan, 2009; Cop-\npens et al., 2011; C. I.

It is impressive that testing effects have been observed \nafter even longer intervals, including intervals of 2 to 4 weeks \n(e.g., Bahrick & Hall, 2005; Butler & Roediger, 2007; Carpen-\nter, Pashler, Wixted, & Vul, 2008; Kromann et al., 2009; \nRohrer, 2009), 2 to 4 months (e.g., McDaniel, Anderson, Der-\nbish, & Morrisette, 2007; Morris & Fritz, 2002; Rawson & \nDunlosky, 2011), 5 to 8 months (McDaniel et al., 2011; Rees, \n1986), 9-11 months (Carpenter et al., 2009), and even 1 to 5 \nyears (Bahrick et al., 1993). These findings are great news for \nstudents and educators, given that a key educational goal is \ndurable knowledge and not just temporary improvements in \nlearning.\n8.3 Effects in representative educational contexts. As \ndescribed above, much of the research on testing effects has \ninvolved educationally relevant materials, tasks, and retention \nintervals. Additionally, several studies have reported testing \neffects using authentic classroom materials (i.e., material \ntaken from classes in which student participants were enrolled; \nCarpenter et al., 2009; Cranney et al., 2009; Kromann et al., \n2009; McDaniel et al., 2007; Rawson & Dunlosky, 2011; \nRees, 1986; V ojdanoska et al., 2010). Whereas the criterion \nmeasures in these studies involved experimenter-devised tests \nor no-stakes pop quizzes, research has also shown effects of \npractice testing on actual summative course assessments \n(Balch, 1998; Daniel & Broida, 2004; Lyle & Crawford, 2011; \nMcDaniel et al., 2011; McDaniel et al., 2012).\nFor example, a study by McDaniel et al.

More structured forms of practice testing (e.g., \nmultiple-choice, short-answer, and fill-in-the-blank tests) are \noften readily available to students via practice problems or \nquestions included at the end of textbook chapters or in the \nelectronic supplemental materials that accompany many text-\nbooks. With that said, students would likely benefit from some \nbasic instruction on how to most effectively use practice tests, \ngiven that the benefits of testing depend on the kind of test, \ndosage, and timing. As described above, practice testing is par-\nticularly advantageous when it involves retrieval and is contin-\nued until items are answered correctly more than once within \nand across practice sessions, and with longer as opposed to \nshorter intervals between trials or sessions.\nConcerning the effectiveness of practice testing relative to \nother learning techniques, a few studies have shown benefits \nof practice testing over concept mapping, note-taking, and \nimagery use (Fritz et al., 2007; Karpicke & Blunt, 2011; \nMcDaniel et al., 2009; Neuschatz, Preston, Toglia, & \nNeuschatz, 2005), but the most frequent comparisons have \ninvolved pitting practice testing against unguided restudy. The \nmodal outcome is that practice testing outperforms restudying, \nalthough this effect depends somewhat on the extent to which \npractice tests are accompanied by feedback involving presen-\ntation of the correct answer. Although many studies have \nshown that testing alone outperforms restudy, some studies \nhave failed to find this advantage (in most of these cases, accu-\nracy on the practice test has been relatively low). In contrast, \nthe advantage of practice testing with feedback over restudy is \nextremely robust. Practice testing with feedback also consis-\ntently outperforms practice testing alone.\nAnother reason to recommend the implementation of feed-\nback with practice testing is that it protects against persevera-\ntion errors when students respond incorrectly on a practice \ntest. For example, Butler and Roediger (2008) found that a \nmultiple-choice practice test increased intrusions of false \nalternatives on a final cued-recall test when no feedback was \nprovided, whereas no such increase was observed when feed-\nback was given. Fortunately, the corrective effect of feedback \ndoes not require that it be presented immediately after the \npractice test. Metcalfe et al. (2009) found that final-test perfor-\nmance for initially incorrect responses was actually better \nwhen feedback had been delayed than when it had been imme-\ndiate. Also encouraging is evidence suggesting that feedback \nis particularly effective for correcting high-confidence errors \n(e.g., Butterfield & Metcalfe, 2001). Finally, we note that the \neffects of practice-test errors on subsequent performance tend \nto be relatively small, often do not obtain, and are heavily out-\nweighed by the positive benefits of testing (e.g., Fazio et al., \n2010; Kang, Pashler, et al., 2011; Roediger & Marsh, 2005). \nThus, potential concerns about errors do not constitute a \nserious issue for implementation, particularly when feedback \nis provided.\nFinally, although we have focused on students\u2019 use of prac-\ntice testing, in keeping with the purpose of this monograph, \nwe briefly note that instructors can also support student learn-\ning by increasing the use of low-stakes or no-stakes practice \ntesting in the classroom.

On the basis of the \nevidence described above, we rate practice testing as having \nhigh utility. Testing effects have been demonstrated across an \nimpressive range of practice-test formats, kinds of material, \nlearner ages, outcome measures, and retention intervals. Thus, \npractice testing has broad applicability. Practice testing is not \nparticularly time intensive relative to other techniques, and it \ncan be implemented with minimal training. Finally, several \nstudies have provided evidence for the efficacy of practice \ntesting in representative educational contexts. Regarding rec-\nommendations for future research, one gap identified in the \nliterature concerns the extent to which the benefits of practice \ntesting depend on learners\u2019 characteristics, such as prior \nknowledge or ability. Exploring individual differences in test-\ning effects would align well with the aim to identify the \nbroader generalizability of the benefits of practice testing. \nMoreover, research aimed at more thoroughly identify the \ncauses of practice-test effects may provide further insights into \nmaximizing these effects.\n9 Distributed practice\nTo-be-learned material is often encountered on more than one \noccasion, such as when students review their notes and then \nlater use flashcards to restudy the materials, or when a topic is \ncovered in class and then later studied in a textbook. Even so, \nstudents mass much of their study prior to tests and believe \nthat this popular cramming strategy is effective. Although \ncramming is better than not studying at all in the short term, \ngiven the same amount of time for study, would students be \nbetter off spreading out their study of content? The answer to \nthis question is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d The term distributed- \npractice effect refers to the finding that distributing learning \nover time (either within a single study session or across ses-\nsions) typically benefits long-term retention more than does \nmassing learning opportunities back-to-back or in relatively \nclose succession.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3711, "end_char_idx": 6304, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4afb7679-6d40-4a32-80de-adadbfec5c8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4afb7679-6d40-4a32-80de-adadbfec5c8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd13a42f-da9e-43d6-bb14-1df7af96150c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "cb2384d5292e96ca13746412fa9f29003c76facee0d17528a479f6913a89f494", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d736e248-4edb-4ad2-b9ca-1c1f862bd628", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f62990cdd225ec8bef36f90814ed112bf968a6dd616c4b1d247d0dfa036f3ffe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "36  Dunlosky et al.\nGiven the volume of research on distributed practice, an \nexhaustive review of the literature is beyond the scope of this \narticle. Fortunately, this area of research benefits from exten-\nsive review articles (e.g., Benjamin & Tullis, 2010; Cepeda, \nPashler, Vul, Wixted, & Rohrer, 2006; Delaney, Verkoeijen, & \nSpirgel, 2010; Dempster & Farris, 1990; Donovan & Radosev-\nich, 1999; Janiszewski, Noel, & Sawyer, 2003), which pro-\nvided foundations for the current review. In keeping with \nrecent reviews (Cepeda et al., 2006; Delaney et al., 2010), we \nuse the term distributed practice to encompass both spacing \neffects (i.e., the advantage of spaced over massed practice) and \nlag effects (i.e., the advantage of spacing with longer lags over \nspacing with shorter lags), and we draw on both literatures for \nour summary.\n9.1 General description of distributed practice and why it \nshould work. To illustrate the issues involved, we begin with \na description of a classic experiment on distributed practice, in \nwhich students learned translations of Spanish words to crite-\nrion in an original session (Bahrick, 1979). Students then par-\nticipated in six additional sessions in which they had the \nchance to retrieve and relearn the translations (feedback was \nprovided). Figure 10 presents results from this study. In the \nzero-spacing condition (represented by the circles in Fig. 10), \nthe learning sessions were back-to-back, and learning was \nrapid across the six massed sessions. In the 1-day condition \n(represented by the squares in Fig. 10), learning sessions were \nspaced 1 day apart, resulting in slightly more forgetting across \nsessions (i.e., lower performance on the initial test in each ses-\nsion) than in the zero-spacing condition, but students in the \n1-day condition still obtained almost perfect accuracy by the \nsixth session. In contrast, when learning sessions were sepa-\nrated by 30 days, forgetting was much greater across sessions, \nand initial test performance did not reach the level observed in \nthe other two conditions, even after six sessions (see triangles \nin Fig. 10). The key point for our present purposes is that the \npattern reversed on the final test 30 days later, such that the \nbest retention of the translations was observed in the condition \nin which relearning sessions had been separated by 30 days. \nThat is, the condition with the most intersession forgetting \nyielded the greatest long-term retention. Spaced practice  \n(1 day or 30 days) was superior to massed practice (0 days), \nand the benefit was greater following a longer lag (30 days) \nthan a shorter lag (1 day).\nMany theories of distributed-practice effects have been \nproposed and tested. Consider some of the accounts currently \nunder debate (for in-depth reviews, see Benjamin & Tullis, \n2010; Cepeda et al., 2006). One theory invokes the idea of \ndeficient processing, arguing that the processing of material \nduring a second learning opportunity suffers when it is close in \ntime to the original learning episode. Basically, students do not \nhave to work very hard to reread notes or retrieve something \nfrom memory when they have just completed this same activ-\nity, and furthermore, they may be misled by the ease of this \nsecond task and think they know the material better than they \nreally do (e.g., Bahrick & Hall, 2005). Another theory involves \nreminding; namely, the second presentation of to-be-learned \nmaterial serves to remind the learner of the first learning \nopportunity, leading it to be retrieved, a process well known to \nenhance memory (see the Practice Testing section above). \nSome researchers also draw on consolidation in their explana-\ntions, positing that the second learning episode benefits from \nany consolidation of the first trace that has already happened. \nGiven the relatively large magnitude of distributed-practice \neffects, it is plausible that multiple mechanisms may contrib-\nute to them; hence, particular theories often invoke different \ncombinations of mechanisms to explain the effects.\n9.2 How general are the effects of distributed practice? \nThe distributed-practice effect is robust.

In both Donovan and \nRadosevich\u2019s (1999) and Janiszewski et al.\u2019s (2003) meta-\nanalyses, distributed practice was associated with moderate \neffect sizes for recall of verbal stimuli. As we describe below, \nthe distributed-practice effect generalizes across many of the \ncategories of variables listed in Table 2.\n9.2a Learning conditions. Distributed practice refers to a par-\nticular schedule of learning episodes, as opposed to a particular \nkind of learning episode. That is, the distributed-practice effect \nrefers to better learning when learning episodes are spread out \nin time than when they occur in close succession, but those \nlearning episodes could involve restudying material, retrieving \ninformation from memory, or practicing skills.

Because much theory on the distributed-prac-\ntice effect is derived from research on the spacing of study epi-\nsodes, we focus on that research, but we also discuss relevant \nstudies on distributed retrieval practice. In general, distributed \npractice testing is better than distributed study (e.g., Carpenter \net al., 2009), as would be expected from the large literature on \nthe benefits of practice testing.\nOne of the most important questions about distributed prac-\ntice involves how to space the learning episodes\u2014that is, how \nshould the multiple encoding opportunities be arranged? \nCepeda et al. (2006) noted that most studies have used rela-\ntively short intervals (less than 1 day), whereas we would \nexpect the typical interval between educational learning \nopportunities (e.g., lecture and studying) to be longer. Recall \nthat the classic investigation by Bahrick (1979) showed a \nlarger distributed-practice effect with 30-day lags between \nsessions than with 1-day lags (Fig. 10); Cepeda et al. (2006) \nnoted that \u201cevery study examined here with a retention inter-\nval longer than 1 month demonstrated a benefit from distribu-\ntion of learning across weeks or months\u201d (p. 370; \u201cretention \ninterval\u201d here refers to the time between the last study oppor-\ntunity and the final test).\nHowever, the answer is not as simple as \u201clonger lags are \nbetter\u201d\u2014the answer depends on how long the learner wants to \nretain information. Impressive data come from Cepeda, Vul, \nRohrer, Wixted, and Pashler (2008), who examined people\u2019s \nlearning of trivia facts in an internet study that had 26 different \nconditions, which combined different between-session inter-\nvals (from no lag to a lag of 105 days) with different retention \nintervals (up to 350 days). In brief, criterion performance was \nbest when the lag between sessions was approximately 10\u2013\n20% of the desired retention interval. For example, to remem-\nber something for 1 week, learning episodes should be spaced \n12 to 24 hours apart; to remember something for 5 years, the \nlearning episodes should be spaced 6 to 12 months apart. Of \ncourse, when students are preparing for examinations, the \ndegree to which they can space their study sessions may be \nlimited, but the longest intervals (e.g., intervals of 1 month or \nmore) may be ideal for studying core content that needs to be \nretained for cumulative examinations or achievement tests that \nassess the knowledge students have gained across several \nyears of education.\nFinally, the distributed-practice effect may depend on the \ntype of processing evoked across learning episodes. In the \nmeta-analysis by Janiszewski et al. (2003), intentional pro-\ncessing was associated with a larger effect size (M = .35) than \nwas incidental processing (M = .24). Several things should be \nnoted. First, the distributed-practice effect is sometimes \nobserved with incidental processing (e.g., R. L. Greene, 1989; \nToppino, Fearnow-Kenney, Kiepert, & Teremula, 2009); it is \nnot eliminated across the board, but the average effect size is \nslightly (albeit significantly) smaller. Second, the type of pro-\ncessing learners engage in may covary with the intentionality \nof their learning, with students being more likely to extract \nmeaning from materials when they are deliberately trying to \nlearn them. In at least two studies, deeper processing yielded a \ndistributed-practice effect whereas more shallow processing \ndid not (e.g., Challis, 1993; Delaney & Knowles, 2005). \nWhereas understanding how distributed-practice effects \nchange with strategy has important theoretical implications, \nthis issue is less important when considering applications to \neducation, because when students are studying, they presum-\nably are intentionally trying to learn.\n9.2b Student characteristics.

The majority of distributed-\npractice experiments have tested undergraduates, but effects \nhave also been demonstrated in other populations. In at least \nsome situations, even clinical populations can benefit from \ndistributed practice, including individuals with multiple scle-\nrosis (Goverover, Hillary, Chiaravalloti, Arango-Lasprilla, & \nDeLuca, 2009), traumatic brain injuries (Goverover, Arango-\nLasprilla, Hillary, Chiaravalloti, & DeLuca, 2009), and amne-\nsia (Cermak, Verfaellie, Lanzoni, Mather, & Chase, 1996). In \ngeneral, children of all ages benefit from distributed study. For \nexample, when learning pictures, children as young as pre-\nschoolers recognize and recall more items studied after longer \nlags than after shorter lags (Toppino, 1991; Toppino, Kasser-\nman, & Mracek, 1991). Similarly, 3-year-olds are better able \nto classify new exemplars of a category if the category was \noriginally learned through spaced rather than massed study \n(Vlach, Sandhofer, & Kornell, 2008). Even 2-year-olds show \nbenefits of distributed practice, such that it increases their later \nability to produce studied words (Childers & Tomasello, \n2002). These benefits of spacing for language learning also \noccur for children with specific language impairment (Riches, \nTomasello, & Conti-Ramsden, 2005).\nAt the other end of the life span, older adults learning paired \nassociates benefit from distributed practice as much as young \nadults do (e.g., Balota, Duchek, & Paullin, 1989). Similar con-\nclusions are reached when spacing involves practice tests \nrather than study opportunities (e.g., Balota et al., 2006; Logan \n& Balota, 2008) and when older adults are learning to classify \nexemplars of a category (as opposed to paired associates; Kor-\nnell, Castel, Eich, & Bjork, 2010). In summary, learners of \ndifferent ages benefit from distributed practice, but an open \nissue is the degree to which the distributed-practice effect may \nbe moderated by other individual characteristics, such as prior \nknowledge and motivation.\n9.2c Materials. Distributed-practice effects have been \nobserved with many types of to-be-learned materials, including \ndefinitions (e.g., Dempster, 1987), face-name pairs (e.g., Car-\npenter & DeLosh, 2005), translations of foreign vocabulary \nwords (e.g., Bahrick & Hall, 2005), trivia facts (e.g., Cepeda  \net al., 2008), texts (e.g., Rawson & Kintsch, 2005), lectures \n(e.g., Glover & Corkill, 1987), and pictures (e.g., Hintzman & \nRogers, 1973). Distributed study has also yielded improved per-\nformance in a range of domains, including biology (Reynolds & \nGlaser, 1964) and advertising (e.g., Appleton-Knapp, Bjork, & \nWickens, 2005).

For instance, distributed-practice effects are large for \nfree recall but are smaller (or even nonexistent) for tasks that \nare very complex, such as airplane control (Donovan & Rados-\nevich, 1999). It is not clear how to map these kinds of complex \ntasks, which tend to have a large motor component, onto the \ntypes of complex tasks seen in education. The U.S. Institute of \nEducation Sciences guide on organizing study to improve \nlearning explicitly notes that \u201cone limitation of the literature is \nthat few studies have examined acquisition of complex bodies \nof structured information\u201d (Pashler et al., 2007, p. 6). The data \nthat exist (which are reviewed below) have come from class-\nroom studies and are promising.\n9.2d Criterion tasks. We alluded earlier to the fact that dis-\ntributed-practice effects are robust over long retention inter -\nvals, with Cepeda and colleagues (2008) arguing that the ideal \nlag between practice sessions would be approximately 10\u2013\n20% of the desired retention interval. They examined learning \nup to 350 days after study; other studies have shown benefits \nof distributed testing after intervals lasting for months (e.g., \nCepeda et al., 2009) and even years (e.g., Bahrick et al., 1993; \nBahrick & Phelps, 1987). In fact, the distributed-practice \neffect is often stronger on delayed tests than immediate ones, \nwith massed practice (cramming) actually benefitting perfor-\nmance on immediate tests (e.g., Rawson & Kintsch, 2005).\nMuch research has established the durability of distributed-\npractice effects over time, but much less attention has been \ndevoted to other kinds of criterion tasks used in educational \ncontexts. The Cepeda et al. (2009) meta-analysis, for example, \nfocused on studies in which the dependent measure was verbal \nfree recall. The distributed-practice effect has been general-\nized to dependent measures beyond free recall, including mul-\ntiple-choice questions, cued-recall and short-answer questions \n(e.g., Reynolds & Glaser, 1964), frequency judgments (e.g., \nHintzman & Rogers, 1973), and, sometimes, implicit memory \n(e.g., R. L. Greene, 1990; Jacoby & Dallas, 1981). More gen-\nerally, although studies using these basic measures of memory \ncan inform the field by advancing theory, the effects of distrib-\nuted practice on these measures will not necessarily generalize \nto all other educationally relevant measures. Given that stu-\ndents are often expected to go beyond the basic retention of \nmaterials, this gap is perhaps the largest and most important to \nfill for the literature on distributed practice. With that said, \nsome relevant data from classroom studies are available; we \nturn to these in the next section.\n9.3 Effects in representative educational contexts. Most \nof the classroom studies that have demonstrated distributed-\npractice effects have involved spacing of more than just study \nopportunities. It is not surprising that real classroom exercises \nwould use a variety of techniques, given that the goal of edu-\ncators is to maximize learning rather than to isolate the contri-\nbutions of individual techniques. Consider a study by Sobel, \nCepeda, and Kapler (2011) in which fifth graders learned \nvocabulary words. Each learning session had multiple steps: A \nteacher read and defined words; the students wrote down the \ndefinitions; the teacher repeated the definitions and used them \nin sentences, and students reread the definitions; finally, the \nstudents wrote down the definitions again and created sen-\ntences using the words.

A mix of teacher \ninstruction and student practice was also involved in a demon-\nstration of the benefits of distributed practice for learning pho-\nnics in first graders (Seabrook, Brown, & Solity, 2005).\nAnother study examined learning of statistics across two \nsections of the same course, one of which was taught over a \n6-month period and the other of which covered the same mate-\nrial in an 8-week period (Bud\u00e9, Imbos, van de Wiel, & Berger, \n2011). The authors took advantage of a curriculum change at \ntheir university that allowed them to compare learning in a \nclass taught before the university reduced the length of the \ncourse with learning in a class taught after the change. The cur-\nriculum change meant that lectures, problem-based group \nmeetings, and lab sessions (as well as student-driven study, \nassignments, etc.) were implemented within a much shorter \ntime period; in other words, a variety of study and retrieval \nactivities were more spaced out in time in one class than in the \nother. Students whose course lasted 6 months outperformed \nstudents in the 8-week course both on an open-ended test tap-\nping conceptual understanding (see Fig. 11) and on the final \nexam (Fig. 12). Critically, the two groups performed similarly \non a control exam from another course (Fig. 12), suggesting \nthat the effects of distributed practice were not due to ability \ndifferences across classes.\nFinally, a number of classroom studies have examined the \nbenefits of distributed practice tests. Distributed practice test-\ning helps students in actual classrooms learn history facts \n(Carpenter et al., 2009), foreign language vocabulary (K. C. \nBloom & Shuell, 1981), and spelling (Fishman et al., 1968).\n9.4 Issues for implementation. Several obstacles may arise \nwhen implementing distributed practice in the classroom. \nDempster and Farris (1990) made the interesting point that \nmany textbooks do not encourage distributed learning, in that \nthey lump related material together and do not review previ-\nously covered material in subsequent units.

These textbooks also contained less variability in \nsets of problems than did comparable textbooks from the for-\nmer Soviet Union. Thus, one issue students face is that their \nstudy materials may not be set up in a way that encourages \ndistributed practice.\nA second issue involves how students naturally study. \nMichael (1991) used the term procrastination scallop to \ndescribe the typical study pattern\u2014namely, that time spent \nstudying increases as an exam approaches. Mawhinney, Bos-\ntow, Laws, Blumenfield, and Hopkins (1971) documented this \npattern using volunteers who agreed to study in an observation \nroom that allowed their time spent studying to be recorded. \nWith daily testing, students studied for a consistent amount of \ntime across sessions. But when testing occurred only once \nevery 3 weeks, time spent studying increased across the inter-\nval, peaking right before the exam (Mawhinney et al., 1971). \nIn other words, less frequent testing led to massed study \nimmediately before the test, whereas daily testing effectively \nled to study that was distributed over time. The implication is \nthat students will not necessarily engage in distributed study \nunless the situation forces them to do so; it is unclear whether \nthis is because of practical constraints or because students do \nnot understand the memorial benefits of distributed practice.\nWith regard to the issue of whether students understand the \nbenefits of distributed practice, the data are not entirely defini-\ntive. Several laboratory studies have investigated students\u2019 \nchoices about whether to mass or space repeated studying of \npaired associates (e.g., GRE vocabulary words paired with \ntheir definitions). In such studies, students typically choose \nbetween restudying an item almost immediately after learning \n(massing) or restudying the item later in the same session \n(spacing). Although students do choose to mass their study \nunder some conditions (e.g., Benjamin & Bird, 2006; Son, \n2004), they typically choose to space their study of items (Pyc \n& Dunlosky, 2010; Toppino, Cohen, Davis, & Moors, 2009). \nThis bias toward spacing does not necessarily mean that stu-\ndents understand the benefits of distributed practice per se \n(e.g., they may put off restudying a pair because they do not \nwant to see it again immediately), and one study has shown \nthat students rate their overall level of learning as higher after \nmassed study than after spaced study, even when the students \nhad experienced the benefits of spacing (e.g., Kornell & Bjork, \n2008). Other recent studies have provided evidence that stu-\ndents are unaware of the benefits of practicing with longer, as \nopposed to shorter, lags (Pyc & Rawson, 2012b; Wissman  \net al., 2012).\nIn sum, because of practical constraints and students\u2019 \npotential lack of awareness of the benefits of this technique, \nstudents may need some training and some convincing that \ndistributed practice is a good way to learn and retain informa-\ntion. Simply experiencing the distributed-practice effect may \nnot always be sufficient, but a demonstration paired with \ninstruction about the effect may be more convincing to stu-\ndents (e.g., Balch, 2006).\n9.5 Distributed practice: Overall assessment. On the basis \nof the available evidence, we rate distributed practice as hav-\ning high utility: It works across students of different ages, with \na wide variety of materials, on the majority of standard labora-\ntory measures, and over long delays.

Finally, future work should \nisolate the contributions of distributed study from those of dis-\ntributed retrieval in educational contexts.\n10 Interleaved practice\nIn virtually every kind of class at every grade level, students \nare expected to learn content from many different subtopics or \nproblems of many different kinds. For example, students in a \nneuroanatomy course would learn about several different divi-\nsions of the nervous system, and students in a geometry course \nwould learn various formulas for computing properties of \nobjects such as surface area and volume. Given that the goal is \nto learn all of the material, how should a student schedule his \nor her studying of the different materials? An intuitive \napproach, and one we suspect is adopted by most students, \ninvolves blocking study or practice, such that all content from \none subtopic is studied or all problems of one type are prac-\nticed before the student moves on to the next set of material. In \ncontrast, recent research has begun to explore interleaved \npractice, in which students alternate their practice of different \nkinds of items or problems. Our focus here is on whether inter-\nleaved practice benefits students\u2019 learning of educationally \nrelevant material.\nBefore we present evidence of the efficacy of this tech-\nnique, we should point out that, in contrast to the other tech-\nniques we have reviewed in this monograph, many fewer \nstudies have investigated the benefits of interleaved practice \non measures relevant to student achievement. Nonetheless, we \nelected to include this technique in our review because (a) \nplenty of evidence indicates that interleaving can improve \nmotor learning under some conditions (for reviews, see Brady, \n1998; R. A. Schmidt & Bjork, 1992; Wulf & Shea, 2002) and \n(b) the growing literature on interleaving and performance on \ncognitive tasks is demonstrating the same kind of promise.\n10.1 General description of interleaved practice and why \nit should work. Interleaved practice, as opposed to blocked \npractice, is easily understood by considering a method used by \nRohrer and Taylor (2007), which involved teaching college \nstudents to compute the volumes of different geometric solids. \nStudents had two practice sessions, which were separated by 1 \nweek. During each practice session, students were given tuto-\nrials on how to find the volume for four different kinds of geo-\nmetric solids and completed 16 practice problems (4 for each \nsolid). After the completion of each practice problem, the cor-\nrect solution was shown for 10 seconds. Students in a blocked-\npractice condition first read a tutorial on finding the volume of \na given solid, which was immediately followed by the four \npractice problems for that kind of solid. Practice solving vol-\numes for a given solid was then followed by the tutorial and \npractice problems for the next kind of solid, and so on. Stu-\ndents in an interleaved-practice group first read all four tutori-\nals and then completed all the practice problems, with the \nconstraint that every set of four consecutive problems included \none problem for each of the four kinds of solids. One week \nafter the second practice session, all students took a criterion \ntest in which they solved two novel problems for each of the \nfour kinds of solids. Students\u2019 percentages of correct responses \nduring the practice sessions and during the criterion test are \npresented in Figure 13, which illustrates a typical interleaving \neffect: During practice, performance was better with blocked \npractice than interleaved practice, but this advantage dramati-\ncally reversed on the criterion test, such that interleaved prac-\ntice boosted accuracy by 43%.\nOne explanation for this impressive effect is that interleav-\ning gave students practice at identifying which solution \nmethod (i.e., which of several different formulas) should be \nused for a given solid (see also, Mayfield & Chase, 2002). Put \ndifferently, interleaved practice helps students to discriminate \nbetween the different kinds of problems so that they will be \nmore likely to use the correct solution method for each one. \nCompelling evidence for this possibility was provided by Tay-\nlor and Rohrer (2010).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4728, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f18fbf75-0d81-4d05-808e-f0bac9235270": {"__data__": {"id_": "f18fbf75-0d81-4d05-808e-f0bac9235270", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3b66ca93-79b7-44f7-8d80-9f209ca31c82", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "f16c0dd1e9a979e3bc7d479c5171764f39b7631d598089faee663e92c7edc5c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d10e300-3607-469d-b2fa-93fae819b871", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "53c148b21bb13f097622fb5962b387a9cac9e19432b2ef5c2304571e89bf0be1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Students\u2019 percentages of correct responses \nduring the practice sessions and during the criterion test are \npresented in Figure 13, which illustrates a typical interleaving \neffect: During practice, performance was better with blocked \npractice than interleaved practice, but this advantage dramati-\ncally reversed on the criterion test, such that interleaved prac-\ntice boosted accuracy by 43%.\nOne explanation for this impressive effect is that interleav-\ning gave students practice at identifying which solution \nmethod (i.e., which of several different formulas) should be \nused for a given solid (see also, Mayfield & Chase, 2002).

After practicing \npartial problems, students practiced full problems, in which \nthey were shown a prism with a number of base sides (e.g., 14 \nsides) and a term for a single component (e.g., edges). Stu-\ndents had to produce the correct formula (b \u00d7 3) and solve the \nproblem by substituting the appropriate value of b (14 \u00d7 3). \nMost important, students in a blocked-practice group com-\npleted all partial- and full-practice problems for one prism fea-\nture (e.g., angles) before moving onto the next. For students in \nan interleaved-practice group, each block of four practice \nproblems included one problem for each of the four prism fea-\ntures. One day after practice, a criterion test was administered \nin which students were asked to solve full problems that had \nnot appeared during practice.\nAccuracy during practice was greater for students who had \nreceived blocked practice than for students who had received \ninterleaved practice, both for partial problems (99% vs. 68%, \nrespectively) and for full problems (98% vs. 79%). By con-\ntrast, accuracy 1 day later was substantially higher for students \nwho had received interleaved practice (77%) than for students \nwho had received blocked practice (38%). As with Rohrer and \nTaylor (2006), a plausible explanation for this pattern is that \ninterleaved practice helped students to discriminate between \nvarious kinds of problems and to learn the appropriate formula \nto apply for each one. This explanation was supported by a \ndetailed analysis of errors the fourth graders made when solv-\ning the full problems during the criterion task. Fabrication \nerrors involved cases in which students used a formula that \nwas not originally trained (e.g., b \u00d7 8), whereas discrimination \nerrors involved cases in which students used one of the four \nformulas that had been practiced but was not appropriate for a \ngiven problem. As shown in Figure 14, the two groups did not \ndiffer in fabrication errors, but discrimination errors were \nmore common after blocked practice than after interleaved \npracticed. Students who received interleaved practice appar-\nently were better at discriminating among the kinds of prob-\nlems and consistently applied the correct formula to each one.\nHow does interleaving produce these benefits? One expla-\nnation is that interleaved practice promotes organizational \nprocessing and item-specific processing because it allows stu-\ndents to more readily compare different kinds of problems. For \ninstance, in Rohrer and Taylor (2007), it is possible that when \nstudents were solving for the volume of one kind of solid (e.g., \na wedge) during interleaved practice, the solution method used \nfor the immediately prior problem involving a different kind \nof solid (e.g., a spheroid) was still in working memory and \nhence encouraged a comparison of the two problems and their \ndifferent formulas. Another possible explanation is based on \nthe distributed retrieval from long-term memory that is \nafforded by interleaved practice. In particular, for blocked \npractice, the information relevant to completing a task \n(whether it be a solution to a problem or memory for a set of \nrelated items) should reside in working memory; hence, par-\nticipants should not have to retrieve the solution. So, if a stu-\ndent completes a block of problems solving for volumes of \nwedges, the solution to each new problem will be readily \navailable from working memory. By contrast, for interleaved \npractice, when the next type of problem is presented, the solu-\ntion method for it must be retrieved from long-term memory. \nSo, if a student has just solved for the volume of a wedge and \nthen must solve for the volume of a spheroid, he or she must \nretrieve the formula for spheroids from memory. Such delayed \npractice testing would boost memory for the retrieved infor-\nmation (for details, see the Practice Testing section above). \nThis retrieval-practice hypothesis and the discriminative-con-\ntrast hypothesis are not mutually exclusive, and other mecha-\nnisms may also contribute to the benefits of interleaved \npractice.\n10.2 How general are the effects of interleaved practice?\n10.2a Learning conditions.

During practice, the presentation of \npaintings was either blocked by artist (e.g., all paintings by Jan \nBlencowe were presented first, followed by all paintings by \nRichard Lindenberg, and so on) or interleaved. Most impor-\ntant, a third group received blocked practice, but instead of \nviewing the paintings one right after another in a massed fash-\nion, a cartoon drawing was presented in between the presenta-\ntion of each painting (the cartoons were presented so that the \ntemporal spacing in this spaced-block-practice group was the \nsame as that for the interleaved group). Criterion performance \nwas best after interleaved practice and was significantly better \nthan after either standard or temporally spaced blocked prac-\ntice. No differences occurred in performance between the two \nblocked-practice groups, which indicates that spacing alone \nwill not consistently benefit concept formation.\nThis outcome is more consistent with the discriminative-\ncontrast hypothesis than the retrieval-practice hypothesis. In \nparticular, on each trial, the group receiving temporally spaced \nblocked practice presumably needed to retrieve (from long-\nterm memory) what they had already learned about a painters\u2019 \nstyle, yet doing so did not boost their performance. That is, \ninterleaved practice encouraged students to identify the criti-\ncal differences among the various artists\u2019 styles, which in turn \nhelped students discriminate among the artists\u2019 paintings on \nthe criterion test. According to this hypothesis, interleaved \npractice may further enhance students\u2019 ability to develop accu-\nrate concepts (e.g., a concept of an artist\u2019s style) when exem-\nplars of different concepts are presented simultaneously. For \ninstance, instead of paintings being presented separately but in \nan interleaved fashion, a set of paintings could be presented at \nthe same time. In this case, a student could more readily scan \nthe paintings of the various artists to identify differences \namong them. Kang and Pashler (2012) found that simultane-\nous presentation of paintings from different artists yielded \nabout the same level of criterion performance (68%) as stan-\ndard interleaving did (65%), and that both types of interleaved \npractice were superior to blocked practice (58%; for a similar \nfinding involving students learning to classify birds, see Wahl-\nheim, Dunlosky, & Jacoby, 2011).\nFinally, the amount of instruction and practice that students \ninitially receive with each task may influence the degree to \nwhich interleaving all tasks enhances performance. In fact, in \neducational contexts, introducing a new concept or problem \ntype (e.g., how to find the volume of a spheroid) would natu-\nrally begin with initial instruction and blocked practice with \nthat concept or problem type, and most of the studies reported \nin this section involved an introduction to all tasks before \ninterleaving began. The question is how much initial practice \nis enough, and whether students with low skill levels (or stu-\ndents learning to solve more difficult tasks) will require more \npractice before interleaving begins. Given that skill level and \ntask difficulty have been shown to moderate the benefits of \ninterleaving in the literature on motor learning (e.g., Brady, \n1998; Wulf & Shea, 2002), it seems likely that they do the \nsame for cognitive tasks. If so, the dosage of initial instruction \nand blocked practice should interact with the benefits of inter-\nleaving, such that more pretraining should be required for \nyounger and less skilled students, as well as for more complex \ntasks.\nConsistent with this possibility are findings from Rau, \nAleven, and Rummel (2010), who used various practice sched-\nules to help teach fifth and sixth graders about fractions. Dur-\ning practice, students were presented with different ways to \nrepresent fractions, such as with pie charts, line segments, and \nset representations.

The majority of studies on \ninterleaved practice have included college-aged students, and \nacross these studies, sometimes interleaved practice has \nboosted performance, and sometimes it has not. Even so, dif-\nferences in the effectiveness of interleaved practice for this \nage group are likely more relevant to the kind of task employed \nor, perhaps, to the dosage of practice, factors that we discuss in \nother sections. Some studies have included college students \nwho were learning tasks relevant to their career goals\u2014for \ninstance, engineering students who were learning to diagnose \nsystem failures (e.g., de Croock, van Merri\u00ebnboer, & Paas, \n1998) and medical students who were learning to interpret \nelectrocardiograms (Hatala, Brooks, & Norman, 2003). We \nhighlight outcomes from these studies in the Materials subsec-\ntion (10.2c) below. Finally, Mayfield and Chase (2002) con-\nducted an extensive intervention to train algebra to college \nstudents with poor math skills; interleaving was largely suc-\ncessful, and we describe this experiment in detail in the Effects \nin Representative Educational Contexts subsection (10.3) \nbelow.\nConcerning younger students, as reported above, Taylor \nand Rohrer (2010) reported that fourth graders benefited from \ninterleaved practice when they were learning how to solve \nmathematical problems. In contrast, Rau et al. (2010) used \nvarious practice schedules to help teach fifth and sixth graders \nabout fractions and found that interleaved practice did not \nboost performance. Finally, Olina, Reiser, Huang, Lim, and \nPark (2006) had high school students learn various rules for \ncomma usage with interleaved or blocked practice; higher-\nskill students appeared to be hurt by interleaving (although \npretests scores favored those in the blocked group, and that \nadvantage may have carried through to the criterion test), and \ninterleaving did not help lower-skill students.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3818, "end_char_idx": 6690, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a779048c-b33a-4c38-ac7a-91bed942a97c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a779048c-b33a-4c38-ac7a-91bed942a97c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1e594db-916f-4f95-9dec-cdf48a730192", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "fde91e7c8ea9a992dd480f7bf0b57f77ef0156ee9cd4088bcb833d1bd516156f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e5cbcf0-d39e-4783-b3b1-d063fdd183e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d9d1235154e636c6f3fedb5a5376697887317956cfb35c9715bfde985922207", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Improving Student Achievement 43\n10.2c Materials. The benefits of interleaved practice have \nbeen explored using a variety of cognitive tasks and materials, \nfrom the simple (e.g., paired associate learning) to the rela-\ntively complex (e.g., diagnosing failures of a complicated \npiece of machinery). Outcomes have been mixed. Schneider, \nHealy, and Bourne (1998, 2002) had college students learn \nFrench vocabulary words from different categories, such as \nbody parts, dinnerware, and foods. Across multiple studies, \ntranslation equivalents from the same category were blocked \nduring practice or were interleaved. Immediately after prac-\ntice, students who had received blocked practice recalled more \ntranslations than did students who had received interleaved \npractice (Schneider et al., 2002). One week after practice, cor-\nrect recall was essentially the same in the blocked-practice \ngroup as in the interleaved-practice group. In another study \n(Schneider et al., 1998, Experiment 2), interleaved practice led \nto somewhat better performance than blocked practice on a \ndelayed test, but this benefit was largely due to a slightly lower \nerror rate. Based on these two studies, it does not appear that \ninterleaved practice of vocabulary boosts retention.\nMore promising are results from studies that have investi-\ngated students\u2019 learning of mathematics. We have already \ndescribed some of these studies above (Rohrer & Taylor, 2007; \nTaylor & Rohrer, 2010; but see Rau et al., 2010). Other math \nskills that have been trained include the use of Boolean func-\ntions (Carlson & Shin, 1996; Carlson & Yaure, 1990) and \nalgebraic skills (Mayfield & Chase, 2002). For the former, \ninterleaved practice improved students\u2019 speed in solving mul-\ntistep Boolean problems, especially when students could pre-\nview the entire multistep problem during solution (Carlson & \nShin, 1996). For the latter, interleaving substantially boosted \nstudents\u2019 ability to solve novel algebra problems (as we dis-\ncuss in detail below).\nVan Merri\u00ebnboer and colleagues (de Croock & van Merri\u00ebn-\nboer, 2007; de Croock et al., 1998; van Merri\u00ebnboer, de Croock, \n& Jelsma, 1997; van Merri\u00ebnboer, Schuurman, de Croock, & \nPaas, 2002) trained students to diagnose problems that occurred \nin a distiller system in which different components could fail; \npractice at diagnosing failures involving each component was \neither blocked or interleaved during practice. Across their stud-\nies, interleaved practice sometimes led to better performance on \ntransfer tasks (which involved new combinations of system fail-\nures), but it did not always boost performance, leading the \nauthors to suggest that perhaps more practice was needed to \ndemonstrate the superiority of interleaved practice (de Croock \n& van Merri\u00ebnboer, 2007). Blocked and interleaved practice \nhave also been used to train students to make complex multidi-\nmensional judgments (Helsdingen, van Gog, & van Merri\u00ebn-\nboer, 2011a, 2011b), with results showing that decision making \non criterion tests was better after interleaved than blocked prac-\ntice. One impressive outcome was reported by Hatala et al. \n(2003), who trained medical students to make electrocardio-\ngram diagnoses for myocardial infarction, ventricular hypertro-\nphy, bundle branch blocks, and ischemia. The criterion test was \non novel diagnoses, and accuracy was substantially greater after \ninterleaved practice (47%) than after blocked practice (30%).\nFinally, interleaved practice has been shown to improve the \nformation of concepts about artists\u2019 painting styles (Kang & \nPashler, 2012; Kornell & Bjork, 2008) and about bird classifi-\ncations (Wahlheim et al., 2011). The degree to which the ben-\nefits of interleaving improve concept formation across \ndifferent kinds of concepts (and for students of different abili-\nties) is currently unknown, but research and theory by Gold-\nstone (1996) suggest that interleaving will not always be \nbetter. In particular, when exemplars within a category are dis-\nsimilar, blocking may be superior, because it will help learners \nidentify what the members of a category have in common.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4142, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e5cbcf0-d39e-4783-b3b1-d063fdd183e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e5cbcf0-d39e-4783-b3b1-d063fdd183e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1e594db-916f-4f95-9dec-cdf48a730192", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "fde91e7c8ea9a992dd480f7bf0b57f77ef0156ee9cd4088bcb833d1bd516156f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a779048c-b33a-4c38-ac7a-91bed942a97c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "1529100612453266.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/1529100612453266.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1618194, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "8b5b2662e6250f5da9e36134c87a5492c009aa73c3c24f109ab438e82e36c212", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The criterion test was \non novel diagnoses, and accuracy was substantially greater after \ninterleaved practice (47%) than after blocked practice (30%).\nFinally, interleaved practice has been shown to improve the \nformation of concepts about artists\u2019 painting styles (Kang & \nPashler, 2012; Kornell & Bjork, 2008) and about bird classifi-\ncations (Wahlheim et al., 2011).

In particular, when exemplars within a category are dis-\nsimilar, blocking may be superior, because it will help learners \nidentify what the members of a category have in common. By \ncontrast, when exemplars from different categories are similar \n(as with the styles of artists and the classifications of birds \nused in the prior interleaving studies on concept formation), \ninterleaving may work best because of discriminative contrast \n(e.g., Carvalho & Goldstone, 2011). These possibilities should \nbe thoroughly explored with naturalistic materials before any \ngeneral recommendations can be offered concerning the use of \ninterleaved practice for concept formation.\n10.2d Criterion tasks. In the literature on interleaving, the \nmaterials that are the focus of instruction and practice are used \nas the criterion task. Thus, if students practice solving prob-\nlems of a certain kind, the criterion task will involve solving \ndifferent versions of that kind of problem. For this reason, the \ncurrent section largely reflects the analysis of the preceding \nsection on materials (10.2c). One remaining issue, however, \nconcerns the degree to which the benefits of interleaved prac-\ntice are maintained across time. Although the delay between \npractice and criterion tests for many of the studies described \nabove was minimal, several studies have used retention inter-\nvals as long as 1 to 2 weeks. In some of these cases, inter -\nleaved practice benefited performance (e.g., Mayfield & \nChase, 2002; Rohrer & Taylor, 2007), but in others, the poten-\ntial benefits of interleaving did not manifest after the longer \nretention interval (e.g., de Croock & van Merri\u00ebnboer, 2007; \nRau et al., 2010). In the latter cases, interleaved practice may \nnot have been potent at any retention interval. For instance, \ninterleaved practice may not be potent for learning foreign-\nlanguage vocabulary (Schneider et al., 1998) or for students \nwho have not received enough practice with a complex task \n(de Croock & van Merri\u00ebnboer, 2007).\n10.3 Effects in representative educational contexts. It \nseems plausible that motivated students could easily use inter-\nleaving without help. Moreover, several studies have used pro-\ncedures for instruction that could be used in the classroom \n(e.g., Hatala et al., 2003; Mayfield & Chase, 2002; Olina et al., \n2006; Rau et al, 2010). We highlight one exemplary study \nhere. Mayfield and Chase (2002) taught algebra rules to col-\nlege students with poor math skills across 25 sessions. In dif-\nferent sessions, either a single algebra rule was introduced or \npreviously introduced rules were reviewed.

Tests were administered prior to train-\ning, during the session after each review, and then 4 to 9 weeks \nafter practice ended. On the tests, students had to apply the \nrules they had learned as well as solve problems by using \nnovel combinations of the trained rules. The groups performed \nsimilarly at the beginning of training, but by the final tests, \nperformance on both application and problem-solving items \nwas substantially better for the interleaved group, and these \nbenefits were still evident (albeit no longer statistically signifi-\ncant) on the delayed retention test.\n10.4 Issues for implementation. Not only is the result from \nMayfield and Chase (2002) promising, their procedure offers \na tactic for the implementation of interleaved practice, both by \nteachers in the classroom and by students regulating their \nstudy (for a detailed discussion of implementation, see Rohrer, \n2009). In particular, after a given kind of problem (or topic) \nhas been introduced, practice should first focus on that partic-\nular problem. After the next kind of problem is introduced \n(e.g., during another lecture or study session), that problem \nshould first be practiced, but it should be followed by extra \npractice that involves interleaving the current type of problem \nwith others introduced during previous sessions. As each new \ntype of problem is introduced, practice should be interleaved \nwith practice for problems from other sessions that students \nwill be expected to discriminate between (e.g., if the criterion \ntest will involve a mixture of several types of problems, then \nthese should be practiced in an interleaved manner during \nclass or study sessions). Interleaved practice may take a bit \nmore time to use than blocked practice, because solution times \noften slow during interleaved practice; even so, such slowing \nlikely indicates the recruitment of other processes\u2014such as \ndiscriminative contrast\u2014that boost performance. Thus, teach-\ners and students could integrate interleaved practice into their \nschedules without too much modification.\n10.5 Interleaved practice: Overall recommendations. On \nthe basis of the available evidence, we rate interleaved prac-\ntice as having moderate utility. On the positive side, inter-\nleaved practice has been shown to have relatively dramatic \neffects on students\u2019 learning and retention of mathematical \nskills, and teachers and students should consider adopting it in \nthe appropriate contexts. Also, interleaving does help (and \nrarely hinders) other kinds of cognitive skills. On the negative \nside, the literature on interleaved practice is currently small, \nbut it contains enough null effects to raise concern. Although \nthe null effects may indicate that the technique does not con-\nsistently work well, they may instead reflect that we do not \nfully understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of \ninterleaving and therefore do not always use it appropriately. \nFor instance, in some cases, students may not have had enough \ninstruction or practice with individual tasks to reap the bene-\nfits of interleaved practice. Given the promise of interleaved \npractice for improving student achievement, there is a great \nneed for research that systematically evaluates how its bene-\nfits are moderated by dosage during training, student abilities, \nand the difficulty of materials.\nClosing Remarks\nRelative utility of the learning techniques\nOur goal was to provide reviews that were extensive enough to \nallow anyone interested in using a particular technique to \njudge its utility for his or her own instructional or learning \ngoals. We also realized that offering some general ratings (and \nthe reasons behind them) might be useful to readers interested \nin quickly obtaining an overview on what technique may work \nbest.

To do so, we have provided an assessment of how each \ntechnique fared with respect to the generalizability of its  \nbenefits across the four categories of variables listed in  \nTable 2, issues for implementation, and evidence for its effec-\ntiveness from work in representative educational contexts (see \nTable 4). Our goal for these assessments was to indicate both \n(a) whether sufficient evidence is available to support conclu-\nsions about the generalizability of a technique, issues for its \nimplementation, or its efficacy in educational contexts, and, if \nsufficient evidence does exist, (b) whether it indicates that the \ntechnique works.3 For instance, practice testing received an \nassessment of Positive (P) for criterion tasks; this rating indi-\ncates that we found enough evidence to conclude that practice \ntesting benefits student performance across a wide range of \ncriterion tasks and retention intervals. Of course, it does not \nmean that further work in this area (i.e., testing with different \ncriterion tasks) would not be valuable, but the extent of the \nevidence is promising enough to recommend it to teachers and \nstudents.\nA Negative (N) rating indicates that the available evidence \nshows that the learning technique does not benefit perfor -\nmance for the particular category or issue. For instance, despite \nits popularity, highlighting did not boost performance across a \nvariety of criterion tasks, so it received a rating of N for this \nvariable.\nA Qualified (Q) rating indicates that both positive and neg-\native evidence has been reported with respect to a particular \ncategory or issue. For instance, the keyword mnemonic \nreceived a Q rating for materials, because evidence indicates \nthat this technique does work for learning materials that are \nimagery friendly but does not work well for materials that can-\nnot be easily imagined.\nA rating of Insufficient (I) indicates that insufficient evi-\ndence is available to draw conclusions about the effects of a \ngiven technique for a particular category or issue. For instance, \nelaborative interrogation received an I rating for criterion tasks \nbecause we currently do not know whether its effects are dura-\nble across educationally relevant retention intervals.

In these \ncases, enough evidence exists to evaluate a technique on one \ndimension of a category or issue, yet insufficient evidence is \navailable for some other dimension. For instance, self-expla-\nnation received a P-I rating for criterion tasks because the \navailable evidence is positive on one dimension (generaliz-\nability across a range of criterion tasks) but is insufficient on \nanother key dimension (whether the benefit of self-explana-\ntion generalizes across longer retention intervals). As another \nexample, rereading received a Q-I rating for criterion tasks \nbecause evidence for the effectiveness of this technique over \nlong retention intervals is qualified (i.e., under some learning \nconditions, it does not produce an effect for longer retention \nintervals), and insufficient evidence is available that is rele-\nvant to its effectiveness across different kinds of criterion \ntasks (e.g., rereading does boost performance on recall tasks, \nbut little is known as to its benefits for comprehension). When \ntechniques have multiple ratings for one or more variables, \nreaders will need to consult the reviews for details.\nFinally, we used these ratings to develop an overall utility \nassessment for each of the learning techniques. The utility \nassessments largely reflect how well the benefits of each learn-\ning technique generalize across the different categories of \nvariables (e.g., for how many variables the technique received \na P rating). For example, the keyword mnemonic and imagery \nuse for text learning were rated low in utility in part because \ntheir effects are limited to materials that are amenable to imag-\nery and because they may not work well for students of all \nages. Even so, some teachers may decide that the benefits of \ntechniques with low-utility ratings match their instructional \ngoals for their students. Thus, although we do offer these easy-\nto-use assessments of each learning technique, we also encour-\nage interested teachers and students to carefully read each \nreview to make informed decisions about which techniques \nwill best meet their instructional and learning goals.\nImplications for research on learning \ntechniques\nA main goal of this monograph was to develop evidence-based \nrecommendations for teachers and students about the relative \nutility of various learning techniques. A related goal was to \nidentify areas that have been underinvestigated and that will \nrequire further research before evidence-based recommenda-\ntions for their use in education can be made. A number of these \ngaps are immediately apparent upon inspection of Table 4. To \nhighlight a few, we do not yet know the extent to which many \nof the learning techniques will benefit students of various \nages, abilities, and levels of prior knowledge. Likewise, with a \nfew exceptions (e.g., practice testing and distributed practice), \nthe degree to which many of the techniques support durable \nlearning (e.g., over a number of weeks) is largely unknown, \npartly because investigations of these techniques have typi-\ncally involved a single session that included both practice and \ncriterion tests (for a discussion of the limitations of such sin-\ngle-session research, see Rawson & Dunlosky, 2011). Finally, \nfew techniques have been evaluated in representative educa-\ntional contexts.\nThis appraisal (along with Table 4) suggests two directions \nfor future research that could have immediate implications for \neducation. First, more research is needed to fully explore the \ndegree to which the benefits of some techniques generalize to \nthe variables listed in Table 2. Particularly important will be \ninvestigations that evaluate the degree to which interactions \namong the variables limit or magnify the benefits of a given \ntechnique.

We realize that such research efforts can be \ntime-consuming and costly, but conducting them will be cru-\ncial for recommending educational changes that will have  \na reasonable likelihood of improving student learning and \nachievement.\nImplications for students, teachers, and student \nachievement\nPressley and colleagues (Pressley, 1986; Pressley, Goodchild, \net al., 1989) developed a good-strategy-user model, according \nto which being a sophisticated strategy user involves \u201cknow-\ning the techniques that accomplish important life goals (i.e., \nstrategies), knowing when and how to use those methods . . . \nand using those methods in combination with a rich network \nof nonstrategic knowledge that one possesses about the world\u201d \n(p. 302). However, Pressley, Goodchild, et al. (1989) also \nnoted that \u201cmany students are committed to ineffective strate-\ngies . . . moreover, there is not enough professional evaluation \nof techniques that are recommended in the literature, with \nmany strategies oversold by proponents\u201d (p. 301). We agree \nand hope that the current reviews will have a positive impact \nwith respect to fostering further scientific evaluation of the \ntechniques.\nConcerning students\u2019 commitment to ineffective strategies, \nrecent surveys have indicated that students most often endorse \nthe use of rereading and highlighting, two strategies that we \nfound to have relatively low utility. Nevertheless, some stu-\ndents do report using practice testing, and these students \nappear to benefit from its use. For instance, Gurung (2005) \nhad college students describe the strategies they used in pre-\nparing for classroom examinations in an introductory psychol-\nogy course. The frequency of students\u2019 reported use of practice \ntesting was significantly correlated with their performance on \na final exam (see also Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012). Given that \npractice testing is relatively easy to use, students who do not \ncurrently use this technique should be able to incorporate it \ninto their study routine.\nWhy don\u2019t many students consistently use effective tech-\nniques? One possibility is that students are not instructed \nabout which techniques are effective or how to use them effec-\ntively during formal schooling. Part of the problem may be \nthat teachers themselves are not told about the efficacy of vari-\nous learning techniques. Given that teachers would most likely \nlearn about these techniques in classes on educational psy-\nchology, it is revealing that most of the techniques do not \nreceive sufficient coverage in educational-psychology text-\nbooks. We surveyed six textbooks (cited in the Introduction), \nand, except for mnemonics based on imagery (e.g., the key-\nword mnemonic), none of the techniques was covered by all of \nthe books. Moreover, in the subset of textbooks that did \ndescribe one or more of these techniques, the coverage in most \ncases was relatively minimal, with a brief description of a \ngiven technique and relatively little guidance on its use, effec-\ntiveness, and limitations. Thus, many teachers are unlikely \ngetting a sufficient introduction to which techniques work best \nand how to train students to use them.\nA second problem may be that a premium is placed on \nteaching students content and critical-thinking skills, whereas \nless time is spent teaching students to develop effective tech-\nniques and strategies to guide learning. As noted by McNa-\nmara (2010), \u201cthere is an overwhelming assumption in our \neducational system that the most important thing to deliver to \nstudents is content\u201d (p. 341, italics in original). One concern \nhere is that students who do well in earlier grades, in which \nlearning is largely supervised, may struggle later, when they \nare expected to regulate much of their own learning, such as in \nhigh school or college. Teaching students to use these tech-\nniques would not take much time away from teaching content \nand would likely be most beneficial if the use of the techniques \nwas consistently taught across multiple content areas, so that \nstudents could broadly experience their effects on learning and \nclass grades. Even here, however, recommendations on how to \ntrain students to use the most effective techniques would ben-\nefit from further research.

Even here, however, recommendations on how to \ntrain students to use the most effective techniques would ben-\nefit from further research. One key issue concerns the earliest \nage at which a given technique could (or should) be taught. \nTeachers can expect that upper elementary students should be \ncapable of using many of the techniques, yet even these stu-\ndents may need some guidance on how to most effectively \nimplement them. Certainly, identifying the age at which stu-\ndents have the self-regulatory capabilities to effectively use a \ntechnique (and how much training they would need to do so) \nis an important objective for future research. Another issue is \nhow often students will need to be retrained or reminded to use \nthe techniques to ensure that students will continue to use \nthem when they are not instructed to do so. Given the promise \nof some of the learning techniques, research on professional \ndevelopment that involves training teachers to help students \nuse the techniques would be valuable.\nBeyond training students to use these techniques, teachers \ncould also incorporate some of them into their lesson plans. \nFor instance, when beginning a new section of a unit, a teacher \ncould begin with a practice test (with feedback) on the most \nimportant ideas from the previous section. When students are \npracticing problems from a unit on mathematics, recently \nstudied problems could be interleaved with related problems \nfrom previous units. Teachers could also harness distributed \npractice by re-presenting the most important concepts and \nactivities over the course of several classes. When introducing \nkey concepts or facts in class, teachers could engage students \nin explanatory questioning by prompting them to consider \nhow the information is new to them, how it relates to what \nthey already know, or why it might be true.

The learning tech-\nniques described in this monograph will not be a panacea for \nimproving achievement for all students, and perhaps obvi-\nously, they will benefit only students who are motivated and \ncapable of using them. Nevertheless, when used properly, we \nsuspect that they will produce meaningful gains in perfor-\nmance in the classroom, on achievement tests, and on many \ntasks encountered across the life span. It is obvious that many \nstudents are not using effective learning techniques but could \nuse the more effective techniques without much effort, so \nteachers should be encouraged to more consistently (and \nexplicitly) train students to use learning techniques as they are \nengaged in pursuing various instructional and learning goals.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Reed Hunt, Mark McDaniel, Roddy Roediger, and Keith \nThiede for input about various aspects of this monograph. We appre-\nciate constructive comments about a draft from Sean Kang, Alexsa \nMacKendrick, Richard Mayer, Hal Pashler, Dan Robinson, and Doug \nRohrer.

McDonnell Foundation\u2019s \n21st Century Science Initiative.\nNotes\n1. We also recommend a recent practice guide from the U.S. Institute \nof Education Sciences (Pashler et al., 2007), which discusses some \nof the techniques described here. The current monograph, however, \nprovides more in-depth and up-to-date reviews of the techniques and \nalso reviews some techniques not included in the practice guide.\n2. Although this presentation mode does not involve reading per se, \nreading comprehension and listening comprehension processes are \nhighly similar aside from differences at the level of decoding the per-\nceptual input (Gernsbacher, Varner, & Faust, 1990).\n3. We did not include learning conditions as a category of variable in \nthis table because the techniques vary greatly with respect to relevant \nlearning conditions. Please see the reviews for assessments of how \nwell the techniques generalized across relevant learning conditions.\nReferences\nAgarwal, P. K., Karpicke, J. D., Kang, S. H. K., Roediger, H.

Past\nresearch has yielded mixed results on their effectiveness, and scant research has com-\npared portable technologies with each other or focused on smartphones specifically.\nWe compared college students\u2019 learning of vocabulary on paper, laptop, and smart-\nphone. Students were randomly assigned to one platform for reviewing vocabulary\nflashcards, and then they completed a memory quiz and answered questions regarding\nperceptions of these technologies. Results showed equivalency in students\u2019 learning\nacross platforms, with the only exception being that students spent longer reviewing\npaper flashcards.

Quantitative and qualitative data also suggested that, though students quickly\nlabel both laptops and smartphones as helpful for education, they see more educational\nvalue in laptops. This research suggests that smartphones present new ways of learning,\nbut care must be taken with how smartphones are utilized in educational settings.\nKeywords\nflashcards, digital media, smartphones, postsecondary education, learning\n1Department of Psychology, The College of Idaho, Caldwell, Idaho, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKara Sage, Department of Psychology, The College of Idaho, 2112 Cleveland Blvd, Caldwell, ID 83605,\nUSA.\nEmail: ksage@collegeofidaho.edu\nJournal of Educational T echnology\nSystems\n0(0) 1\u201325\n!

Students are increasingly utilizing the\npowers of digital technologies for their education (e.g., Callaghan, 2018; Hamm\net al., 2014; Stec et al., 2018; Williams & Pence, 2011). Websites and applica-\ntions, such as Quizlet and Socrative, have many tools to ease the learner\u2019s strug-\ngle when reviewing educational material. Students\u2019 increasing recruitment of\nsuch tools invites researchers to question their effectiveness.\nEach new learning platform has a unique set of affordances for students; these\naffordances vary between paper and digital resources as well as between different\ndigital devices. They may vary in their perceptual affordances such as text size.\nThey may also vary in cognitive affordances; for instance, one device might allow\nfor easier concentration. Different learning platforms vary physically as well. The\ninterface with technology is different from paper, and technology has the bene\ufb01t\nof access to many applications or websites on multiple devices.\nAre these digital tools helpful for learning? Mixed research exists (Delgado\net al., 2018; Sage et al., 2019a, 2019b; Singer & Alexander, 2017). Digital tools can\nbe helpful, but students often prefer paper. Furthermore, many factors outside of\nplatform in\ufb02uence students\u2019 learning such as the type of material to be studied. To\nkeep pace with innovative trends, researchers must also explore newer technolo-\ngies. For instance, most college students today own a smartphone, sometimes at\nhigher percentages than they own laptops (e.g., Anshari et al., 2017; Sage et al.,\n2020). A student\u2019s approach to studying can in\ufb02uence their academic performance\n(Dunlosky et al., 2013); however, not all studying techniques are equally ef\ufb01ca-\ncious (Putnam et al., 2016). This study focuses on \ufb02ashcards, a common method\nfor memorizing vocabulary (Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012). Through an exploration\nof digital \ufb02ashcards, multiple technologies, and analysis of students\u2019 perspectives,\nwe sought to inform best practices for students utilizing digital devices, and\nparticularly smartphones, as educational tools.\nAffordances and Utility of Flashcards\nThis study focuses on \ufb02ashcards. Signi\ufb01cant research has examined \ufb02ashcards as\na popular learning tool for vocabulary, though digital \ufb02ashcards have received\nsigni\ufb01cantly less attention. Flashcards can increase students\u2019 verbal skill (e.g.,\nKupzuk et al., 2011) and positively in\ufb02uence examination scores (e.g., Golding\net al., 2012). Students report that \ufb02ashcards are bene\ufb01cial for such reasons as\nmemorization, convenience, self-quizzing, and repetition (Sage et al., 2019b).\nHowever, \ufb02ashcards can also be detrimental for learning for such reasons as\nbeing a shallow learning approach, a hassle to create, and not being applicable\nto certain classes. Various individual factors play into the success of \ufb02ashcards\nas well, such as students\u2019 motivation and the perceived relevance of the task.\n2 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3098, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7714c14-0e22-4e19-95f8-cf2ffa39f927": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7714c14-0e22-4e19-95f8-cf2ffa39f927", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "126f9505-4ef5-47ed-ad5f-ed9970cb8f3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "b42ac1d8b1aac364fc5e0d528e21bd9203e18a4cd5e7f50fbe739a9bcfd8238b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Paper Flashcards. Traditionally, \ufb02ashcards are made from paper, often index\ncards. The typical \ufb02ashcard is two-sided with a word or question on one side\nand de\ufb01nition or response on the other. Burgess and Murray (2014) reported\nthat college students strongly preferred paper over digital cards for reasons such\nas technical issues and distractions. Sage et al. (2019b) concurred, \ufb01nding that\nstudents felt more satis\ufb01ed with paper over digital cards for such reasons as\nenjoying the physical sensation and minimizing screen exposure.\nAs for learning effectiveness, Hartwig and Dunlosky (2012) reported that\nusing \ufb02ashcards did not relate to students\u2019 grade point average. Conversely,\nGolding et al. (2012) found that \ufb02ashcards can positively in\ufb02uence students\u2019\nexamination scores. Interestingly, Karpicke et al. (2009) suggested that students\nmight traditionally use \ufb02ashcards more to self-test than to learn. Given that\nrepetition is super\ufb01cial, deeper level learning may not occur.\nDigital Flashcards. Growing literature has investigated digital \ufb02ashcards. These\ncards can have unique features for the learner such as audio pronunciations\n(Nakata, 2011). They improve upon traditional paper \ufb02ashcards by offering\nmultimedia, special pacing functionality, and the like. Digital \ufb02ashcards can\nalso be embedded into apps with connected features such as quizzes (Davis,\n2013). Ashcroft et al. (2018) found that students with lower English pro\ufb01ciency\nparticularly bene\ufb01tted from digital learning of vocabulary when compared\nwith paper \ufb02ashcards. Thus, digital \ufb02ashcards may provide opportunities for\ndeeper learning.\nResearch on the effectiveness of digital \ufb02ashcards for learning is mixed. Davis\n(2013) reported that students thought that a \ufb02ashcard app (on an iPod Touch)\nwas helpful, convenient, and easy to transport. The downside though was dis-\ntraction from other apps and uses (e.g., text messaging). Sage et al. (2016)\ncompared paper with several digital \ufb02ashcard sets on a desktop computer, \ufb01nd-\ning that recall was similar between versions. In a follow-up study, Sage et al.\n(2019b) further reported that \ufb02ashcard use on a tablet was superior for learning\nrelative to \ufb02ashcard use on a desktop computer, perhaps given its mobility.\nDizon (2016) concurred, reporting that students preferred studying Quizlet\nvocabulary on their smartphone over a desktop computer. Agreeably, Basoglu\nand Akdemir (2010) found that students\u2019 scores improved more from pre- to\nposttest after using a \ufb02ashcard mobile app over traditional paper. When using\nQuizlet \ufb02ashcards in particular, Anjaniputra and Salsabila (2018) reported that\nQuizlet helped to encourage engagement and persistence among learners.\nThroughout these studies, portability and convenience emerged as key reasons\nfor the success of digital cards.\nComparison. Overall, research presents mixed \ufb01ndings when comparing paper to\ndigital \ufb02ashcards. Studies often report students\u2019 preference for print cards, but\nother studies report increasing utility of digital \ufb02ashcards.

Smartphones may be omnipresent, but little research exists regarding their\nutility as a learning tool. A meta-analysis by Sung et al. (2016) on mobile devices\nin teaching and learning reported that qualitative approaches are more common\nthan quantitative approaches in the literature. They also reported that using\nmobile devices appeared better than using desktop computers or no mobile devi-\nces as an intervention in education, and that handhelds seemed especially bene-\n\ufb01cial for inquiry learning. Mobile devices have promise given their unique features\nincluding personalized interfaces, information access, and communication.\nGrowing literature has supported smartphone use in education. In a study\nfocused on medical students, Robinson et al. (2013) reported that 84% believed\nthat smartphones would be useful or very useful to their learning. Anshari et al.\n(2017) later investigated college students\u2019 views on smartphones via surveys and\nfocus groups. They reported that students often used their smartphones to access\ndigital course materials and relevant information on the internet. Interestingly,\nstudents reported accessing the internet signi\ufb01cantly more frequently on their\nsmartphones than laptops. Students identi\ufb01ed advantages of smartphone use\nsuch as convenience and portability. Students also indicated that they used\ntheir smartphones to communicate with teachers outside of the classroom and\nto collaborate with peers on group assignments. Al-Hariri and Al-Hattami (2017)\ntook this research a step further by looking at the relationship between students\u2019\nuse of mobile technology (in this case, laptops and phones) and academic achieve-\nment. They found a positive relationship, citing such reasons as mobile technol-\nogy supporting independent, self-directed learning, and in facilitating student\ncollaboration. Similarly, Shaw and Tan (2015) employed a smartphone applica-\ntion to help medical students prepare for examinations; they found that users were\nmore likely to engage with questions in the app relative to email and that correct\nanswers positively correlated with later test performance.\nAlternatively, many students and teachers believe that smartphones will inter-\nfere with learning. Tossel et al. (2015) explored smartphone use in college stu-\ndents who had never used a smartphone. Prior to the study, students viewed\nsmartphones favorably for education. Upon conclusion of the study, students\nreported the phones as a distraction, competing for their attention in class.\nHowever, they did report using the devices for educational tasks such as access-\ning course materials and school email. It should be noted that students who have\n4 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3159, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7cdea7d-d411-4bee-9bfb-fbc0d2b26719": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7cdea7d-d411-4bee-9bfb-fbc0d2b26719", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53818295-db12-4dbe-9444-f4b054db53df", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "a2ef48a8eaedb6dbd22330b46694068f845e21bc3e8667faa06cd0bf2447a3b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "owned a smartphone for many years may respond differently than new owners.\nNevertheless, this perception of smartphones may not vary from perceptions\nregarding other technologies. Fried (2008) reported that students using laptops\nwere also distracted during class time. In both cases, personal technology use by\nstudents may be connected to multitasking and detract from students\u2019 under-\nstanding of course material. Kim et al. (2019) found that college students were\ndistracted every 3 to 4 minutes by their phones in the classroom. Persistent\nchecking of social media and constant noti\ufb01cations contribute to addictive\nbehavior toward technology (Du et al., 2019). The mere sight of a smartphone\ncan be distracting (Johannes et al., 2019; Thornton et al., 2014)\nAlthough adopting new technologies has its challenges (e.g., Stec et al., 2018),\nsuch technologies can also provide many opportunities for innovation in edu-\ncation. Thus, we must explore their utility further to better contextualize their\nbene\ufb01ts versus detriments.\nTheoretical Framework\nWhile exploring the literature, two theoretical frameworks emerged as particu-\nlarly relevant for this study. In their research on college students\u2019 iPad use, Stec\net al. (2018) proposed a framework that can be applied to smartphone use as\nwell. They believed that students\u2019 experiences with mobile technology could be\ncategorized into three types of characteristics: drivers (improving their experi-\nence), moderators (moderating the experience), and speed bumps (harming their\nexperience). Such characteristics for iPads likely overlap with smartphones, con-\nsidering both are handheld, portable devices with internet access. Drivers for\niPads included portability, utility as a learning aid, and relevant apps.\nModerators that could tip the scale included the professor\u2019s support, commu-\nnication about the technology, and emotions. For example, if students found\nthat their professor engaged thoughtfully with the technology, they might be\nmore inclined to highlight drivers over speed bumps. Speed bumps included\ndistraction, eyestrain, and technical dif\ufb01culties such as Wi-Fi connection.\nAn older, but also applicable, framework is the Uni\ufb01ed Theory of\nAcceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model (Venkatesh et al., 2003).\nThis model focuses on how performance and effort interrelate when determining\nthe utility of a new technology. For performance, students consider the potential\neffectiveness of the technology, motivation, the \ufb01t to the task, the potential to\nenhance productivity, and whether the technology is better than prior technol-\nogies for the given task. For effort, students anticipate challenges to using the\ntechnology. The perceptions of other people can also have a role.\nOverall, students feeling higher smartphone self-ef\ufb01cacy may be more likely to\nrecognize the positive potential of smartphones for academic learning (Han &\nYi, 2019).\nSage et al. 5", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2933, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95956465-3015-432a-8cdf-8df7d584d79f": {"__data__": {"id_": "95956465-3015-432a-8cdf-8df7d584d79f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f18ca46c-9c91-4632-b577-4736c0611c5b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "fb51d8dde89cd2876c3c89fbe359e8cc404a47a00f164da5eeda99bcfc6d10b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Both frameworks are useful in the context of this study.

Many studies have investigated computers, given their\nlongevity and frequent use in education. More recent research has explored\ntablets, e-readers, and smartphones as well (e.g., Zeng et al., 2016). But current\nresearch is incomplete in unveiling the potential of digital studying tools.\nFor example, in their meta-analysis on digital versus print reading,\nDelgado et al. (2018) emphasized the need for more research on handheld\ndevices. There was some evidence that handheld devices bear more promise\nfor comprehension relative to computers. As mentioned earlier, different plat-\nforms vary in their affordances for learners. For instance, smaller screens,\nsuch as smartphones, may challenge readers in new ways. Kim and Kim\n(2010) point to the possibility of enhanced cognitive load from such character-\nistics as small font size. That said, emerging technologies are constantly evolv-\ning, and improved text quality bene\ufb01ts comprehension with digital texts (Moys\net al., 2018).\nThis study focuses on college students\u2019 learning outcomes from \ufb02ashcards\npresented on paper, laptop, and smartphone. Our work expands current litera-\nture on mobile technologies for educational use in several ways. First, we\nfocused on smartphones, an understudied device becoming more prevalent in\nstudent learning (see meta-analyses: Delgado et al., 2018; Sung et al., 2016), and\ncompared it with another technology (laptop) and traditional paper. Second, we\ninvestigated memory in addition to timing, satisfaction, and cognitive load, to\nsee if any differences between platforms would emerge. As researchers such as\nDelgado et al. (2018) have emphasized, it is important to look beyond just\ndifferences in memory or comprehension. Third, we utilized both quantitative\nand qualitative data to explore students\u2019 perceptions of laptops and smart-\nphones in their education. As stated by Sung et al. (2016), there is a lack of\nquantitative data connecting smartphones to learning. And using both types of\ndata has the potential to shed light on any differences, or lack thereof, in the\nexperimental portion of the study.\nResearch Questions and Hypotheses\nDo Students\u2019 Learning Outcomes Differ Across Platform?This broad question has mul-\ntiple subparts, representing several variables of interest: (a) Does students\u2019\nmemory for the vocabulary words differ?

(c) Does students\u2019 satisfaction differ? (d) Does students\u2019 cognitive load\ndiffer? When comparing platforms, we believed one of two outcomes was likely\nacross all learning variables.\nFor one, we hypothesized (Hypothesis 1a) a paper advantage for all variables,\ngiven research studies showcasing a print preference, including speci\ufb01cally for \ufb02ash-\ncards (Burgess & Murray, 2014; Delgado et al., 2018; Sage et al., 2019b). We believed\nit likely that students would remember more words from paper cards, spend less time\nwith those cards, feel more satis\ufb01ed, and experience less cognitive load. However,\nsome research has suggested a dissipating paper advantage, perhaps especially with\nhandheld devices (e.g., Konget al., 2018). And some promising research on digital\n\ufb02ashcards exists (e.g., Basoglu & Akdemir, 2010; Dizon, 2016). Thus, it seemed\nequally plausible for outcomes to be consistent across platforms (Hypothesis 1b).\nWe sought to extricate these possibilities in our research.\nDo Learning Outcomes Relate?We further hypothesized correlations between learn-\ning measures (Hypothesis 2). Regardless of platform, we believed that higher\nmemory for words would relate to more satisfaction and lower cognitive load.\nFurthermore, satisfaction and cognitive load (effort and dif\ufb01culty) seemed likely\nto negatively correlate. Finally, for time spent reviewing the \ufb02ashcards, it seemed\nplausible that review time would positively relate to comprehension, satisfaction,\nand cognitive load. Past research has supported that performance and perception\nare often associated in such ways (Sage et al., 2019a, 2019b; Teo et al., 2003).\nWhat Are Students\u2019 Experiences With, and Perceptions of, Digital Study Materials?This\nportion was exploratory in nature, to provide both quantitative and qualitative\nsupporting data on student experiences with these technologies and their related\nperceptions. Therefore, we did not have speci\ufb01c hypotheses. Questions focused\non students\u2019 experiences with laptops and smartphones personally and in the\nclassroom, and their views on the educational value of such technologies. These\ndata had the potential to inform our results and elucidate current perceptions of\nsmartphones as educational tools, a relatively understudied area despite the\npervasiveness of smartphones among today\u2019s college students.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 150 undergraduate students (66.7% female, median age\u00bc19 years) at\na Northwestern liberal arts college completed this study for course credit.\nParticipants reported their race as 67% White, 8% Black, 4.7% Asian, 8%\nmixed race, 3.3% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 6% other, 0.7%\nNative Hawaiian or Other Paci\ufb01c Islander, and 2% unreported.

Three other\nindividuals participated, but their data were excluded due to participant\n(n \u00bc2) and experimenter ( n \u00bc1) error. In a between-subjects design, students\nwere randomly assigned to review \ufb02ashcards on paper, laptop, or smartphone\n(n \u00bc50 per condition).\nMaterials\nVocabulary. Flashcard vocabulary was identical to the words used in Sage et al.\n(2016, 2019b). A total of 27 words were taken from Graduate Record\nExaminations (GRE) practice lists (2 practice and 25 test words). Words\nappeared in the same order for every participant. One side of each card had\nthe vocabulary word while the reverse side listed a synonym. Example words\ninclude equipoise (synonym: balance), acumen (synonym: guile), and dearth\n(synonym: absence). This design was thought to provide the appropriate chal-\nlenge level for an 18- to 22-year-old undergraduate liberal arts sample of stu-\ndents and mirrored other vocabulary practice lists (e.g., Kornell, 2009). Students\nwere asked at the end of the study how many words they de\ufb01nitively knew\nbeforehand, and they reported a mean of 1.69 words (SD \u00bc2.72). Thus, these\nwords were largely unfamiliar to participants.\nFlashcard Types. The paper \ufb02ashcards consisted of 4 /C2 6 white index cards. Laptop\nand smartphone \ufb02ashcards came from Quizlet. The laptop had a 14-inch monitor.\nStudents used a mouse to navigate. Smartphones were the users\u2019 personal phones.\nThe Quizlet version was visually similar across all screens, with a typical screen\nsize of /C24 5 inches and high-resolution pixel display. Smartphone models were not\nrecorded, but research assistants running the study reported that common models\nincluded recent versions of the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy.\nMeasures\nVocabulary Quiz. Immediately following their review of the \ufb02ashcards, partici-\npants were given a list of the 25 vocabulary words and could type in the corre-\nsponding synonym. On the next screen, participants were given the same list\nalong with a randomized list of the synonyms to match with those words. The\n\ufb01rst test focused more on recall while the second test was simpler in allowing for\nrecognition instead. There was no time limit, but most students spent about 5 to\n10 minutes on the quiz.\nTiming.

Following the memory quiz, participants responded to three\nquestions regarding their perceptions of the learning experience. Responses were\non 7-point scales, with 0 representing low scoresand 6 representing high scores.\nTo measure cognitive load, participants answered: How much effort did it cost\nyou to review these \ufb02ashcards? How dif\ufb01cult was it for you to learn this material\nfrom these \ufb02ashcards? And to address satisfaction, participants were asked:\nHow satis\ufb01ed are you with these \ufb02ashcards?\nLearning researchers utilize similar self-report questions on cognitive load;\nsuch questions have been found valid and reliable (e.g., Paas et al., 2003; Teo\net al., 2003). Similar questions on satisfaction, and 7-point scales, are typical of\nlearning research (e.g., Kablan & Erden, 2008; Moreno & Valdez, 2005;\nVandewaetere & Clarebout, 2013).\nGeneral Perceptions and Experiences Survey. The survey consisted of selection and\nopen-ended responses. Students were asked to indicate if they personally owned\na smartphone and laptop, in addition to approximate length of ownership and\nfrequency of use. Students reported their perceived technological skills for\nsmartphones and laptops, on a 1 (low)t o5( high) scale (Robinson et al.,\n2013). They were also asked for information on which platform they typically\nreviewed \ufb02ashcards on and their experiences with Quizlet \ufb02ashcards. In addi-\ntion, students in technology conditions were asked if any noti\ufb01cations appeared\non screen during the learning phase.\nStudents also indicated their views on the value of technology, adapted from\nTossel et al. (2015). Students rated their agreement to 24 statements (12 laptop\nand 12 smartphone) via a 1 (strongly disagree)t o5( strongly agree) scale.\nExample statements include \u201cMy smartphone helps me get better grades\u201d and\n\u201cThe smartphone helps me do well on academic tests.\u201d\nStudents then provided information on their overall views on technology in\neducation. Students were asked to what degree their professors encouraged\nuse of laptops and smartphones in the classroom and how professors have\ndone so. The subsequent questions largely mirror questions utilized\nin Robinson et al.\u2019s (2013) research on technology in education. Students\nranked four functions for smartphones and laptops: time management, assessing\nskill, communication, and information gathering. They then selected all the\nwords from a given list that described their attitude toward smartphones and\nlaptop computers in education: brilliant, complicated, distracting, simple, essen-\ntial, unnecessary, expensive, innovative, helpful, and terrible. Finally,\nstudents labeled the impact of smartphones and laptops on their learning in\ncollege as a vital part, useful aid, not helpful, distraction, or other, and explained\ntheir choice.\nDemographics.

On their randomly assigned platform, participants then reviewed the\n\ufb02ashcards. After their review, they took the memory quiz, completed the learner\nperceptions survey, and completed the general perceptions and experiences\nsurvey on a laptop. Students then marked any words they felt they de\ufb01nitively\nknew prior to the study and provided demographic information. Participants\nwere thanked, debriefed, and granted course credit.\nData Analysis Approach\nTo determine the differences between platforms (Hypothesis 1), we used a multi-\nvariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). We opted for the MANOVA approach\ngiven its inclusion of multiple dependent variables in a single analysis. The six\ndependent variables included memory score on the recall quiz and recognition\nquiz, review time, satisfaction level, and self-reported effort and dif\ufb01culty. The\nonly missing data were for two review times. Mean substitution was used to replace\nmissing values. With such a low level of missing data, mean substitution has been\nshown to have similar results relative to other methods of missing data replacement\n(Parent, 2012). For the independent variable of platform, we employed contrasts.\nContrast 1 compared print with digital (combining laptop/smartphone), to deter-\nmine differences between print and digital \ufb02ashcards. Contrast 2 compared laptop\nwith smartphone, to determine variability between digital media.\nTo address Hypothesis 2, correlational analyses informed interrelations\nbetween learning outcomes, with pairwise deletion for the two missing review\ntimes. Finally, we conducted exploratory quantitative and qualitative analyses\non the survey data, indicating themes across responses, to address the third\nresearch question. To code themes from the open-ended questions, two\nresearchers reviewed student responses and made a list of recurrent themes.\nSuch themes emerged as liking a technology for its portability or disliking a\ntechnology for its distraction potential. Two authors met to discuss these emerg-\ning themes and possible interpretations (Bogdan & Bilden, 2007). As data anal-\nysis progressed, these two authors expanded, developed, and merged categories\nas necessary (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). We then coded responses to their respec-\ntive themes. Interrater reliability for all coding was above 90%.\nResults\nDo Students\u2019 Learning Outcomes Differ Across Platforms?\nWhen considering the question of if outcomes differ across platforms, the omni-\nbus MANOVA was signi\ufb01cant, Wilks\u2019 Lambda \u00bc.85, F(12,284) \u00bc1.97, p \u00bc.03,\ng2\np \u00bc.08.\n10 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2691, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8dac4b98-3726-4e2f-8cb6-735df0176e40": {"__data__": {"id_": "8dac4b98-3726-4e2f-8cb6-735df0176e40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e7ceeae0-cd5f-4b43-9550-67ce23526aae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "af650f3a2b354ed9039e6ef0ce8caf27f3b1787b25cb591933e9acfe3a8f3d9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Did students\u2019 memory for the vocabulary words differ?

For the few\nparticipants that did see a noti\ufb01cation, typically it was from Quizlet itself.\nHowever, it is possible Quizlet noti\ufb01cations might have been underreported as\nQuizlet advertisements might not be viewed as traditional noti\ufb01cations. For\nsmartphone users, 46% reported seeing one or two noti\ufb01cations while reviewing\nthe \ufb02ashcards, 12% reported three or four noti\ufb01cations, and 2% reported more\nthan \ufb01ve noti\ufb01cations. Users reported that these noti\ufb01cations were typically for\ndirect communications such as email or text messages. Although noti\ufb01ed, only\ntwo students reported leaving Quizlet to respond to a noti\ufb01cation.\nWhen considering the value of technology survey, adapted from Tossel et al.\n(2015), students\u2019 average reported value of smartphones for education was at the\nneutral midpoint of three on a 5-point scale ( SD \u00bc.57). For laptops, the average\nincreased to 4.06 ( SD \u00bc.51). A paired sample t test indicated that students\nviewed laptops as having more value for education, t(149) \u00bc20.34, p <.001.\nStudents were also asked questions about how their professors were utilizing\nlaptops and smartphones during classes. First, they rated on a 0 ( rarely)t o6\n(frequently) scale if their professors encouraged the use of these technologies in\nthe classroom. Professors sometimes encouraged laptop computers, M \u00bc2.91,\nSD \u00bc1.78, and rarely encouraged smartphone use, M \u00bc1.61, SD \u00bc1.51. A\npaired sample t test indicated that this difference was signi\ufb01cant, t(147) \u00bc\n/C0 8.83, p <.001. When asked how their professors have encouraged use, most\ncommon uses of laptops were general use, note-taking, and research; most\ncommon uses of smartphones were general use and research (see Table 3).\nThe \ufb01nal series of questions was inspired by Robinson et al.\u2019s (2013)\nresearch on technology in education. First, students provided rankings for the\npurpose of smartphones and laptops. As shown in Table 4, communication and\ninformation gathering ranked most highly for both digital media. But commu-\nnication was no. 1 for smartphones while information gathering was no. 1 for\nlaptops.\nSecond, students associated adjectives with the technologies, as they pertain\nto education (see Table 5). While students primarily selected more positive\nadjectives when describing laptops, smartphones had a mix where students\noften selected both negative and positive adjectives to describe the technology.\nWhile students most prominently saw laptops as helpful, essential, expensive,\nSage et al. 13", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3090, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a5792c5-7538-4457-a858-f93b83ac3da9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a5792c5-7538-4457-a858-f93b83ac3da9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5c9807f-32be-4555-be97-548264ca9a02", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "0180ec8085dc92a54b62bc51c37998334ac418fe57292f817e241fc5123d8621", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "and innovative, students saw smartphones as distracting yet helpful, and\nexpensive.\nFinally, students categorized smartphones and laptops as having one of the\nfollowing overall effects on their learning: vital part, useful aid, not helpful, or\nTable 4.Mean Ranking.\nLaptop\nM (SD)\nSmartphone\nM (SD)\nInformation gathering 1.23 (.54) 2.27 (.76)\nCommunication 2.54 (.91) 1.27 (.54)\nAssessing skill 2.71 (.93) 3.26 (.68)\nTime management 3.31 (.79) 3.07 (1.07)\nTable 3.In-Class Use.\nLaptop\n% of sample\nSmartphone\n% of sample\nGeneral in-class use 46.7 49.3\nNote-taking 25.3 1.3\nResearch 27.3 32\nSyllabus access/use 8 5.3\nDiscussion of tech policies 2.7 2.7\nNo devices allowed 17.3 10.7\nNote.

Although\ndigital study materials have been gaining popularity, many college students\nstill resort to print materials for their learning. Our research suggests that\nstudents may learn just as well from digital resources for vocabulary learning.\nThis statement holds true for smartphones, a technology often discouraged by\nteachers and labeled as a distraction by students (e.g., Tossel et al., 2015).\nWe reported equivalent learning outcomes across paper, laptop, and smart-\nphone \ufb02ashcards. The only exception was for timing, and digital resources\nwere favored. Furthermore, in line with past research, learning outcomes inter-\nrelated (Sage et al., 2019a, 2019b; Teo et al., 2003). Students who remembered\nmore words, irrespective of platform, also reported higher satisfaction and lower\nperceptions of dif\ufb01culty. Thus, learning experiences seemed notably similar for\nall students in our study.\nHow might this equivalency between platforms be interpreted? Although\nthese different \ufb02ashcards may provide somewhat variable experiences for learn-\ners, they may overlap enough to invoke similar outcomes, particularly when\nconsidering that studying the cards lasted for only about 10 minutes. Thus,\nTable 6.Student Explanations for Effect on Learning.\nLaptop\n% of sample\nSmartphone\n% of sample\nDigital work 85.3 36\nOrganization 4 15.3\nCommunication 7.3 36.7\nPortable 4.7 1.3\nDistraction 0.67 40.7\nNote-taking 2.7 0.7\nConvenience 5.3 3.3\nOther 4.7 4.7\nSage et al. 15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2142, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8950b00-4259-4844-bf1e-7c35cd993792": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8950b00-4259-4844-bf1e-7c35cd993792", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "04fcd595-fe06-4b0f-823c-ae13d73f55cf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "be55cbd2bbaf5799cb00a026c9aa43e5dc227cd5cca38e5e3e38e2198aa3cf9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "common downsides to studying on technology, such as eyestrain or screen size\n(e.g., Sage et al., 2020), may not have been an issue under the present circum-\nstances. All platforms seemed relatively well liked and not too challenging to\nuse, with cognitive load and satisfaction ratings in the mid-range. Most of our\nsample owned both laptops and smartphones, and familiarity facilitates more\npositive perceptions (Chen et al., 2014; Han & Yi, 2019). Many students had\nexperience using paper and/or Quizlet \ufb02ashcards as well. Students\u2019 high famil-\niarity may have reduced the frustrations that can often emerge when grappling\nwith new technology.\nAnd how might the difference in timing be interpreted? Intuitively, the dif-\nference in timing may be underscored by how long it takes to \ufb02ip versus click/\nswipe on a \ufb02ashcard. The physical act of \ufb02ipping a card might slow down the\nuser to some degree, and the user must take care to not bend or crease the card.\nThere is also the possibility of dropping cards or wanting to straighten or shuf\ufb02e\nthe cards. When using the digital \ufb02ashcards, the program\u2019s functionality allows\nfor quick \ufb02ipping or shuf\ufb02ing at the press of a button. This might explain why\ndifferences in speed often do not emerge for students reading longer passages,\nwhere the functionality is more similar between paper and digital copies (e.g.,\n\ufb02ipping a page vs. scrolling down a .pdf \ufb01le; Sage et al., 2020).\nStudents also reported their experiences with, and perceptions of, laptops and\nsmartphones. Perceptions of technology are constantly evolving; prior research\nhas indicated both pros and cons (e.g., Chang & Ley, 2006; Singer & Alexander,\n2017). Students in our study used laptops and smartphones with regularity\nand felt skilled at both technologies. But their overall perceptions put laptops\nde\ufb01nitively above smartphones for their educational value. They believed that\nlaptops were essential for education, while smartphones could be helpful but\nmay be a distraction or unnecessary.\nHow might we explain this perception? Students may prefer compartmental-\nizing their daily activities to some degree. Although smartphones can often be\nconsidered small computers, students reported their primary purpose as com-\nmunication, with laptops having the primary purpose of information gathering.\nThese rank orders agree with Robinson et al.\u2019s (2013) research with the same\nlist. Student perceptions also aligned well with Anshari et al.\u2019s (2017) research,\nreporting on students\u2019 use of smartphones for communication as well as con-\ncerns about distraction. Agreeably, more than half of students in our smart-\nphone condition saw noti\ufb01cations appear on their phones during the study.\nEven if they did not leave the program to view those noti\ufb01cations, such noti\ufb01-\ncations can accumulate over time and become increasingly distracting. Leynes\net al. (2018) support this statement, \ufb01nding that distractions from smartphones\n(e.g., noti\ufb01cations) can increase cognitive load. Regardless, the convenience\nafforded by a mobile platform seems important. Students may gradually \ufb01nd\nmore bene\ufb01ts in on-the-go or all-in-one devices.\n16 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3189, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a03f5e6-59bf-4bb7-a1dc-4e8081f64852": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a03f5e6-59bf-4bb7-a1dc-4e8081f64852", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2213966-0d60-48c7-b162-bb5355dfe363", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "bbfd0269164ba42ea77b473bf90046e03ff202e4d8b1cd8b3b19a2627131bcf0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Theoretical Framework\nWhen considering the theoretical framework posited by Stec et al. (2018), smart-\nphones and laptops appear somewhat similar and different in their drivers,\nmoderators, and speed bumps. For drivers, aspects such as portability might\nbe enhanced for smartphones, as they \ufb01t in a pocket. And they come with many\nrelevant apps. However, a key moderator could be perceived educational value,\nwhich favored the laptop in our study. Professors also encouraged laptop use\nmore frequently and may have actively discouraged smartphone use, which\ncould be another moderator. As for speed bumps, distraction appeared strongly\nas the top speed bump for smartphones, with many students in our study (and\npast research) reporting this concern. A speed bump for both technologies was\ntheir expense.\nRe\ufb02ecting upon the UTAUT model (Venkatesh et al., 2003), both technolo-\ngies appeared to \ufb01t the task (learning vocabulary) well. The application was\nstraightforward, and students\u2019 cognitive load did not vary across platforms.\nStudents also reported con\ufb01dence in their technological skill; they may have\nfelt high smartphone and laptop self-ef\ufb01cacy (Han & Yi, 2019). Overall, it\nappears that both technologies in this study met this model\u2019s criteria for using\na digital device for academic purposes.\nPractical Implications\nEducators might consider ways to capitalize upon the advantages of different\ntechnologies in their classroom activities. For instance, if smartphones are excel-\nlent for communication, then educators can encourage students to create col-\nlaborative online documents and chat spaces when assigning groupwork.\nEducators can also utilize live review games and polling via smartphone.\nRem/C19on et al. (2017) found that students enjoyed smartphones as a survey plat-\nform, and these interactive approaches were superior to traditional approaches\nsuch as PowerPoint with the blackboard. Student laptops may be useful for in-\nclass activities focused on \ufb01nding information such as looking up academic\narticles for papers or projects.\nCallaghan (2018) further suggested that utilizing mobile technologies in the\nclassroom will vary based on available resources and training of educators. Al-\nFuraih and Al-Awidi (2020) concurred, suggesting that teachers\u2019 views around\nadopting smartphones for classroom use vary by teaching experience and cur-\nricular area. Although early adoption of new technologies can come with chal-\nlenges, educators should not shy away from employing innovative learning\ntechniques that can engage this generation\u2019s digital natives. As previously men-\ntioned, such views on technology from the professor can act as a speed bump in\nstudents\u2019 perception of that technology for learning (Stec et al., 2018).\nSage et al. 17", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2764, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c35eed2d-ae57-4773-bce2-764961e2df27": {"__data__": {"id_": "c35eed2d-ae57-4773-bce2-764961e2df27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b4c132d-25d1-4546-b8b3-f1e8de9cf573", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "08879ec32d6b90b0d18bf30b317b2823510c4096fe4cc8c15bf9d9f7e86066c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Educators must also be cognizant about their policies regarding technology\nuse. Classroom technology policy is often mandated by the individual instruc-\ntor. Bayless et al. (2013) reported that about half of instructors have a policy on\ntheir syllabus. A strict ban against student technology in the classroom may be\nan outdated choice. Faculty members should consider how personal technology\ncould improve assignments and engage students. And to minimize downsides,\nuse of smartphones in the classroom should be very structured, with clear learn-\ning objectives (Tossel et al., 2015).\nAs this study focused on outside-of-the-classroom use of \ufb02ashcards, educa-\ntors might also consider what recommendations they are making to students for\ntheir general studying practices. Telling a student to put their phone away when\nstudying, for instance, may discourage the student from exploring useful appli-\ncations that can facilitate their learning. In line with the UTAUT model (e.g.,\nShin et al., 2011), smartphones can create new learning opportunities for stu-\ndents, if applications are accessible, enjoyable, and easy to use. In conjunction\nwith this recommendation, educational software developers might also focus on\nmaking their applications and websites more mobile-friendly to increase use and\nenhance bene\ufb01ts for students.\nFinally, colleges should consider that not all students will have regular access\nto devices such as laptops or smartphones. Despite rental programs on some\ncampuses, some students cannot afford to purchase such technologies\n(Hargittai, 2010). Thus, for professors to be able to effectively integrate indi-\nvidual technology into their classroom, colleges must provide access for students\nwho may not otherwise have those technologies.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThis research had several key limitations. First, generalizations only extend to\n\ufb02ashcard vocabulary learning. Future research might compare technologies for\nlonger text readings or other studying applications. Also, students\u2019 knowledge of\nthe vocabulary was tested immediately after the learning phase. Relatively, low-\nlevel memory and short-term memory were examined. Future research must\ninvestigate higher level encoding and longer term memory (e.g., reviewing text\npassages and applying the material in alternative ways across time). In this\nstudy, we initially attempted to include a follow-up test of memory online,\nbut signi\ufb01cant attrition and evidence of utilizing outside sources led to those\nresults not being explored. A more rigorous follow-up on student\u2019s knowledge\ncould be very informative. Furthermore, all students completed the quiz and\nquestions on a laptop, instead of using the same platform as their \ufb02ashcards.\nThis approach was taken out of convenience, to prevent dif\ufb01culties with inter-\npreting handwriting and frustrations with typing lengthy streams of text on a\n18 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2939, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bff1a4bf-b7b8-44a5-9689-f9cba2d07182": {"__data__": {"id_": "bff1a4bf-b7b8-44a5-9689-f9cba2d07182", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7f6bd5c-c7b0-4cba-9f74-ab008b909034", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "532d17f54861ff8d9ae93fc8434bd262667f0131f0ce4ad978f878f86e0e5fcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "smartphone screen, but the mismatch for some participants may have in\ufb02uenced\nresults. Future researchers might consider having study materials and compre-\nhension checks centralized on one platform.\nIt would also be interesting to further compare mobile technologies to each\nother. Smartphones showed promise here; future research might compare them\ndirectly to other small-screen mobile devices such as tablets and e-readers.\nResearch comparing handheld devices directly to each other is rare (Delgado\net al., 2018). Research also indicates that users often do not use the unique\ncharacteristics of digital platforms to their advantage (e.g., Ackerman &\nGoldsmith, 2011). Examples of these underutilized features include hyperlinks\nand comprehension quizzes. Gerjets (2017) reported that students may not use\nsuch features given the potential for cognitive overload in an environment\nenriched by hypermedia. However, these features can potentially facilitate in-\nclass performance. Additional research should make use of the unique features\nof digital platforms, as such functionality can set them apart from paper.\nFinally, larger scale research is necessary to determine how digital devices can\nbest be used in the classroom. For example, researchers could incorporate\nsmartphones into a once-a-week classroom activity for an entire semester. The\nresearcher could give regular assessments and see how well this use of the\nsmartphone fared relative to other technologies or no technology at all. Such\na study could also better inform the technology policy that an educator adopts\nin their classroom. Future research could take advantage of qualitative and\nquantitative data sources, asking students and professors to comment on the\nexperience while simultaneously measuring numerical outcomes such as exam-\nination scores.\nConclusion\nDigital studying resources are poised to increase in future years. Past research\nhas been mixed on the utility of such resources. However, students in this study\nlearned vocabulary equally well from paper, laptop, and smartphone. These\ndevices may have varied in their affordances, but ultimately all resulted in sim-\nilar learning outcomes. Students were quick to label the laptop as having more\neducational value than the smartphone but also recognized the smartphone as a\npotential aid to learning. Educators and students should be apprised of the\nutility of these devices and consider how they can be appropriately incorporated\nin the classroom. Educators might reconsider bans on personal technology in\nthe classroom and reframe their guidelines in ways that can help to facilitate\nstudents\u2019 learning. Future research must further investigate the utility of digital\ndevices for students to clarify the most sensible recommendations for educators\nand learners.\nSage et al. 19", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2815, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aaa58ffa-0679-4a76-9283-952f9ab7f682": {"__data__": {"id_": "aaa58ffa-0679-4a76-9283-952f9ab7f682", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f0adc31-c94c-4b90-b475-fe8ac415fa40", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/Flip it or click it .pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 280255, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "26ecb998545776014f3b5bf7c88add89b46a2f15db72e77b97cfc15d72092937", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Acknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Langa Masilela and Kathryn Craig for their contribu-\ntions to data collection and discussions of ideas during this research project.

AZER1, ANTHONY P. S. GUERRERO2 & ALLYN WALSH3\n1King Saud University, Saudi Arabia,2University of Hawai, USA,3McMaster University, Canada\nAbstract\nBackground: In an integrated curriculum such as problem-based learning (PBL), students need to develop a number of learning\nskills and competencies. These cannot be achieved through memorization of factual knowledge but rather through the\ndevelopment of a wide range of cognitive and noncognitive skills that enhance deep learning.\nAim: The aim of this article is to provide students and teachers with learning approaches and learning strategies that enhance deep\nlearning.\nMethods: We reviewed current literature in this area, explored current theories of learning, and used our experience with medical\nstudents in a number of universities to develop these tips.\nResults: Incorporating the methods described, we have developed 12 tips and organized them under three themes. These tips are\n(1) learn how to ask good questions, (2) use analogy, (3) construct mechanisms and concept maps, (4) join a peer-tutoring group,\n(5) develop critical thinking skills, (6) use self-reflection, (7) use appropriate range of learning resources, (8) ask for feedback, (9)\napply knowledge learnt to new problems, (10) practice learning by using simulation, (11) learn by doing and service learning, and\n(12) learn from patients.\nConclusions: Practicing each of these approaches by students and teachers and applying them in day-to-day learning/teaching\nactivities are recommended for optimum performance.\nIntroduction\nIn an integrated curriculum such as problem-based learning\n(PBL), students are encouraged to use a wide range of learning\napproaches that can enforce cognitive skills and the develop-\nment of competencies. This is particularly important in self-\ndirected learning and in meeting the learning outcomes\noutlined in the curriculum. However, students might be new\nto meaningful integrated learning. In most instances, they\ncome from educational systems that encourage rote learning\nand teacher-centered approaches to learning. In such tradi-\ntional systems, teachers deliver the contents in lectures and\nstudents have to review what they were taught. The teacher\nhas to deliver the contents of his/her subject to the students,\nand the students have to passively receive knowledge\ntransferred to them. This is not the case in an integrated\nstudent-centered curriculum, where the students have to take\nthe lead in applying knowledge learnt, providing reasoning for\ntheir actions, and demonstrating deep understanding of the\nconcepts discussed. These cognitive skills require from\nstudents readjusting their learning approaches and developing\na number of approaches that serve this purpose (Azer 2008a;\nMcNamara 2010).\nAccording to Biggs (1994), approaches to learning can be\ndefined as \u2018\u2018ways in which students go about their academic\ntasks, thereby affecting the nature of their learning out-\ncomes.\u2019\u2019 Students\u2019 approaches to learning are viewed as\nbeing responses to the learning environment. These\nresponses are dynamic and open to changes rather than\nbeing fixed entities. They may change to a higher and more\nsophisticated levels to match with the learner\u2019s needs and\nskills/competencies already developed. However, some\nstudents might tend to adopt the same approach toward\ndifferent learning tasks. Changing learning approaches in\nthese students are related to their disposition to change or\ntheir ability to adopt new learning approaches to their new\nlearning environment (Snelgrove & Slater 2003). The leading\nwork of Marton and Saljo (1976) has led to the identification\nof levels for processing materials learnt by students that was\nsubsequently termed deep/superficial approaches to learning\ndichotomy. A student using predominantly a superficial\nlearning approach tends to focus on factual knowledge and\nmemorization of fine details. On the other hand, a student\nundertaking a deep learning approach tends to dig deeper\nand examines the wide range of aspects related to what he/\nshe is learning. The subsequent work of Norton and Dickens\n(1995) and Gibbs (1994) has shown that deep learning\napproaches rather than superficial approaches tend to\npromote academic success (See Figures 1 and 2). Deep\nlearning and the development of cognitive and noncognitive\nskills aim to graduate students who are fit to join the medical/\nhealth care workforce and able to provide safe practice and\nhigh-quality care.\nThere is evidence from research that deep learning can be\ntaught and developed through training and practice.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4680, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffde4908-1e65-4cff-83ad-3be1e4205b92": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffde4908-1e65-4cff-83ad-3be1e4205b92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 546278, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da4d1df1-f01d-4673-bd72-a700a8b7d008", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 546278, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "a56268ef1687b9d773c272a2d6a3fae4950c058ef84e258f00c39ec3c635d683", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "08f1ac4f-445c-40f4-8a92-f5b179f86010", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 546278, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "1b5761eec4c88e9e1d84eec9da1064f19f4eb2e102b7d96c926aa80ba8ef6882", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A student using predominantly a superficial\nlearning approach tends to focus on factual knowledge and\nmemorization of fine details.

These tips are organized under three themes as\nfollows: Theme 1: apply specific techniques that foster deep\nlearning (Tips 1\u20136), Theme 2: master active learning (Tips 7\nand 8), and Theme 3: practice learning beyond the classroom\n(Tips 9\u201312). The article is useful to students and teachers\nworking with students to improve their learning approaches\n(Box 1 summarizes these 12 tips).\nTheme 1:Apply specific techniques that foster deep\nlearning\nOne student in a PBL group has just concluded his\npresentation on the assigned learning issue:\u2018 \u2018renal physiol-\nogy.\u2019\u2019 The remainder of the group members are overwhelmed\nby the complexity of the material, copied from an abbreviated\n\u2018\u2018review book,\u2019\u2019 and the next 20 minutes include uncomfor-\ntable silence and vague comments. The tutor is able to help the\nstudents by first asking them a series of questions (Tip 1) that\nprobe the relationship between basic physiology and the\nclinical findings of the vignette (which describes a patient\nwith acute tubular necrosis following an episode of septic\nshock). The students engage in a thoughtful discussion, and\nare able to laugh as they review humorous analogies for the\nfunctional organization of a nephron (Tip 2). Following other\nstudents\u2019 learning issue presentations (on the mechanisms\nand manifestations of shock, urinalysis 101, and microbiol-\nogy of gram-negative infections), the students are able to\nsynthesize all of the mechanisms in one master diagram (Tip\n3) that explains the basis for all of the patient\u2019s signs and\nsymptoms, and why the treatments were effective. While\nconstructing this diagram, they recognized the need to read\nfurther about the pharmacology of certain antibiotics, and\nresolved to explore this further in their peer-tutoring group (Tip\n4), and they also acknowledged the limitations of the\nreferences (including the review book) they used to research\nTransfer of\nknowledge to\nstudents\nSuperficial\nLearning \nLearner\u2019s brain\nFigure 1.

They usually find little value to reflect on\ntheir learning. On the other hand, learners enforce deep\nlearning style when they raise questions, focus on under-\nstanding, look for relationships and conceptions, generate\nhypotheses, construct complex mechanisms, provide reason-\ning and justification, and use evidence in making decisions.\nThis is usually fostered through asking good open-ended\nquestions as they research a learning resource.\nTherefore, one of the elements of developing meaningful\nunderstanding is to learn how to format good questions in\nrelation to what students want to learn (Graig et al. 2006;\nZhang et al. 2010). Identifying key questions and looking at\ntheir depth, breadth, flow, and whether they address the basic\nprinciples about what they really need to know is essential.\nThe more the learner is clear about what they need to know,\nthe more they are preparing themselves to undertake active\nlearning approaches. Refining these questions and putting\nthem in a logical sequence as students prepare their research\nwill help them to identify which resource to start with and\nwhat they really want to know.\nWhy do students need to learn how to ask questions?\nAsking good open-ended questions help students to:\n. Make their research for a learning issue more focused.\n. Evaluate the different aspects about a concept.\n. Identify what they know, and what they did not know.\n. Go deeper into an issue and develop a meaningful learning.\n. Weigh supportive evidence for and against each hypothesis.\n. Turn learning to a journey of discovery.\n. Make a purpose for their learning.\nHow can questions reinforce deep understanding?\nQuestions can help in reinforcing deep understanding\nwhen students aim at exploring a particular cognitive skill, for\nexample:\n. Generating hypotheses: \u2018\u2018What are the possible causes\nfor ... ?\u2019\u2019\n. Testing a hypothesis: \u2018\u2018What if... ?\u2019\u2019 ... \u2018\u2018Are there relation-\nships between... and ... ?\u2019\u2019\n. Reasoning: \u2018\u2018How can I justify... ?\u2019\u2019\n. Developing an enquiry plan: \u2018\u2018What are my goals? What\napproach should I take? What questions should I ask to\nmake a hypothesis less likely, more likely, or excluded?\u2019\u2019\n. Interpreting findings: \u2018\u2018How these findings are different from\nnormal? What do they mean?\u2019\u2019\n. Examining a process: \u2018\u2018What are the consequences of... ?\n. Explaining: \u2018\u2018How can we explain... ?\u2019\u2019\n. Linking clinical changes with basic sciences: \u2018\u2018What does\nthis relate to our knowledge about normal body... ?\u2019\u2019\n. Critically evaluate: \u2018\u2018What evidence do I have... ?\u2019\u2019\n. Identifying key concepts learnt: \u2018\u2018What is the take home\nmessage?\u2019\u2019\n. Identify learning needs: \u2018\u2018What do I know?\u2019\u2019... \u2018\u2018What do I\nneed to know? How?\u2019\u2019\nTip 2\nUse analogy\nAnalogies are used in science to explain difficult concepts,\nestablish relationships between components of a concept, and\nenforce learning and application. Analogy involves a structural\nalignment or mapping between domains, and aims at\nproviding learners with a familiar frame that they can use to\ncomprehend a more complex system. For example, Emil\nFisher\u2019s famous lock-and-key analogy for the specificity of\nenzyme action has provided scientific communities for over\n100 years with a mental picture of molecular recognition\nprocesses and deep understanding of the creative processes\ninvolved in enzyme function (Lichtenthaler 1994). Johannes\nKepler used the analogy to develop scientific proposals and\nraise important scientific concepts such as the earth and the\nother planets move, rather than the sun. In one of his analogies\nabout planetary motions, he assumed that the planet\ncorresponds to the boat and the sun\u2019s power to the river\u2019s\ncurrent, referring to the role of sun in planetary function and\nmovement (Genter & MarKman 1997). A good number of\nanalogies have been described in the literature to facilitate\nunderstanding of the cardiovascular system (Belloni 1999),\nblood glucose control (Swain 1999), nerve conduction (Sircar\n& Tandon 1996), and glycolysis regulation (Stavrianeas &\nSilverstein 2005).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4378, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "686bf196-c2a9-435f-80b0-8e3bd99cc026": {"__data__": {"id_": "686bf196-c2a9-435f-80b0-8e3bd99cc026", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 546278, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5300bdb-eaf0-413b-bf8e-c697c1444883", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 546278, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "999fdd37e9bfcfd176f07ca386ea3243a56bc1dce5f149ed09ce7f8658062943", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "241ab0f8-5592-4688-8a79-df044bee6199", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EnhancingLearning.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 546278, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "7f30a33ff5dd95d630948f56440a539486405e31fad85c30d0398e9d7ac647b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Johannes\nKepler used the analogy to develop scientific proposals and\nraise important scientific concepts such as the earth and the\nother planets move, rather than the sun.

Allows learners to better understand the different compo-\nnents of a difficult concept.\n. Enables learners to take complicated issue/concept and\ncompare it to something simpler that listeners/readers are\nfamiliar with and clearly understand.\n. Covers three constraints: similarity, structure/function, and\npurpose. A good analogy examines each of these\ncomponents and the similarity established between one\nanalog termed the source or base is more understood than\nthe second analog termed target. The illuminated simila-\nrities provide the basis for analogical transfer, establish-\nment of relationships, and generation of inferences about\nthe target.\nHow can analogy help learners to explore meaningful\nunderstanding?\nBy using analogy, learners can:\n. Identify relationship between the familiar model and the\nnew information they are learning. The more this relation-\nship is well established, the more learners are able to\ncomprehend the function and structure of the new system\nthey are studying.\n. Apply knowledge learnt in different real-life situations with\nconfidence (Busari 2000).\n. Comprehend difficult concepts and how the different\ncomponents contribute to a particular function.\n. Identify new questions in relation to the difficult concept\nthey are learning.\n. Build on knowledge learnt and use the analogy in solving\nsimilar problems.\nS. A.

They do not just summarize their findings or\nput together pieces of information they collected, they rather\nuse innovative strategies to clearly present their new knowl-\nedge in a meaningful way. Students might use originally\ncreated flow diagrams, tables, labeled diagrams, mechanisms,\nor a combination of more than one of these to construct their\nnew knowledge and present their research findings (Guerrero\n2001; Azer 2005). A good approach is to construct the new\nknowledge in a way that shows integration across disciplines,\nlogical flow, a balance between the big picture and fine details,\nand enforces thinking processes as well as demonstrates deep\nunderstanding. Therefore, in this process, the learner deliber-\nately seeks to organize his/her knowledge, incorporates new\nknowledge learnt to what he/she possesses, and demonstrates\ncommitment to meaningful learning. The use of mechanisms\nand concept mapping is a good example of construction of\nknowledge, and integration of knowledge in an organized and\nlogical way (Guerrero 2001; Novak 2003). Construction of\nmechanisms and concept maps requires a number of skills\nfrom the learner, but their use in learning and in assessment\ncan strongly support meaningful learning.\nWhy do students need to learn how to use mechanisms and\nconcept maps?\nUsing mechanisms help students to:\n. Identify areas that they do not know and need to understand.\n. Construct knowledge and integrate knowledge from several\nresources/disciplines.\n. Explore disease pathogenesis and role of contributing\nfactors.\n. Understand the processes involved in diseases, and\nmechanisms by which medications work.\n. Apply the principles learnt to delay the progress of a disease\n(prevention).\nHow can mechanisms and concept maps reinforce deep\nlearning?\nMechanisms and concept maps can help in:\n. Integrating knowledge from several disciplines.\n. Identifying possible contributing factors.\n. Ensuring logical sequence of a process/change.\n. Ensuring that the problem is discussed at body system,\nbody organ, cellular, receptor, and molecular levels.\n. Enabling learners to use mechanisms as a basis for their\nprevention and management plan.\nTip 4\nJoin a peer-tutoring group\nSeveral medical and health schools realized the value of peer-\nteaching programs in improving students\u2019 learning. The aim of\nsuch programs is to enhance the development of learning\nskills and interpersonal skills among undergraduate students.\nWhile peer tutoring could make significant improvement on\nlearning of tutees, it also has benefits for the tutors. Such\nprograms have been evaluated and there is evidence that peer\nteaching is appreciated by students and causes significant\nchanges on teaching and learning. For example, Sobral (2002)\nfound that acting as a peer tutor can be an appealing and\nconstructive educational opportunity to further students\u2019\nacademic development. Peer tutors better understand the\nlearning needs of their fellow students than teachers do; since\nthey have recent similar learning experiences.\nWhy do students need peer teaching?\nPeer teaching can:\n. Help in developing a culture of learning in the college.\n. Encourage active learning where students take a deep\nlearning approach.\n. Enforce collaborative learning.\n. Support students struggling with their learning.\n. Provide a system of partnership in the learning process,\nwhere the teaching and learning are owned by students.\n. Enable students to develop transferable skills such as\ncommunication, interpersonal skills, and time management.\nHow peer teaching can foster student\u2019s learning?\nPeer teaching can help in reinforcing deep understanding\nby:\n.

Affective dispositions: Intellectual integrity, open-minded-\nness, flexibility, contextual perspective, confidence, inquisi-\ntiveness, reflection, creativity, and intuition.\nOther researchers (such as Facione & Facione 1992)\nidentified interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inferences, expla-\nnation, self-regulation for cognitive skills and truth seeking,\nopen-mindedness, inquisitiveness, and maturity for affective\ndisposition. While there might be some elements of connection\namong these different domains, it is clear that these different\ncomponents/levels are integral in critical thinking development.\nWhy do students need to develop critical thinking skills?\nCritical thinking skills enable students to:\n. Develop their self-regulation, analysis, and interpretation\nskills.\n. Enhance their skills in cognitive and affective dispositions\ndiscussed above.\nHow can students develop their critical thinking?\nCritical thinking is a skill that can be developed by students\ngradually as they keep practicing and working on it. So the\nwillingness of the learner to focus on such approach and work\non it is vital.\n. Readjusting their learning approaches from memorization to\ncritical thinking.\n. Continuous training and working on tasks that can reinforce\nstudents\u2019 critical thinking.\n. Using learning resources that encourage learner\u2019s skills such\nas interpretation of findings, analysis, inferences, explana-\ntion, and application of knowledge. These resources may\ninclude computer-aided learning programs and interactive\ne-cases.\n. Receiving feedback on performance and working with\ncolleagues who share with you a passion about exploring\ncritical thinking in their learning.\n. Understanding that such skills are part of continuous life-\nlong learning and continuous development.\nTip 6\nUse self-reflection\nSelf-reflection is a metacognitive process that can occur at all\nstages of an encounter: before, during, and after. It helps the\nlearner to understand both the self and the situation (Azer\n2008b; Sandars 2009). Reflection is a process that can be\ncontrolled and regulated by the learner with the purpose of\ndeveloping various training strategies and enhancing the\nlearning process. The awareness about the self and the\nsituation through reflection will enable the learner to recognize\nunderlying personal values and benefits that are represented\nas professional attitudes and the development of self-efficacy.\nThe continuous practice of reflection along these lines will\nhelp learners to develop a number of skills including planning,\npracticing experiential learning, and changing their future\nresponses to align with the professional attitude. Although a\nrecent study by Lew and Schmidt (2011) found that self-\nreflection has caused limited improvement in students\u2019\nacademic performance, there is evidence that reflection can\nhelp learners to:\n. Become self-regulated and life-long learners.\n. Review their group learning process and their own personal\ninput in their groups.\n. Improve their learning as it is the case in experiential\nlearning (Kolb 1984). According to Kolb, there are four\nphases: in the first phase, the learner has an experience; in\nthe second phase, the learner reflects, which in turn leads to\nthe third phase where the learner makes attempts to\nunderstand their actions or reactions to the experience. This\nusually leads to identification of learning needs and skills\nthat need to be acquired before facing a similar situation. In\nphase four, the learner applies what he/she has learnt. This\nfour-phase cycle may be repeated several times with the\npurpose of improving the learner\u2019s performance.\n. Relate new knowledge to prior understanding.\n. Help them assess their own progress in learning and\ncritically analyze their achievements.\nTheme 2:Master active learning\nAt a future meeting of this tutorial group, students resolve\nto approach a clinical problem by consulting a wider array of\nresources beyond just the abbreviated review book \u2013 in order\nto insure up-to-date information and more specific answers to\ntheir questions about the mechanisms underlying clinical\nsymptoms (Tip 7).

Some of these resources are already\nembedded in the curriculum and the day-by-day teaching/\nlearning activities. What is more important to the learner is\nhow to get the best out of each of these learning resources,\nand how to build links between these learning resources and\nlearning needs. Two areas of importance at this stage are to be\nable to evaluate information, and to be able to apply\npopulation-derived research to individual patients. Students\nare often eager to use clinical resources before they have\ngrasped the fundamental concepts; for example, using\nsummary books, which have been prepared for final year\nstudents or graduates preparing for exams can lead to\nmemorizing lists of differential diagnoses, or presenting signs\nand symptoms to the detriment of developing conceptual\nunderstanding. The use of a wide range of appropriate\nlearning resources could help students in:\n. Self-testing and facilitating the process of long-term recall\nthrough repeated testing (Larsen et al. 2009).\n. Assessing their knowledge and what they already know and\nexploring new aspects of interest to them.\n. Engaging students more efficiently to expand their self-\ndirected learning and find more answers to their questions.\n. Enabling students to compare and contrast between what\nthey learnt from a particular learning session and what they\nhave discussed in other learning resources. The new\nknowledge could help students to construct concept\nmaps, integrate and synthesize information.\n. Providing students with opportunities to explain important\nprocesses/concepts orally and in writing.\n. Allowing students to revisit what they were taught, organize,\nrelate new knowledge, and explain how topics fit together,\nand how to relate fine details to a key scientific principle.\n. Enabling students to self-regulate their learning: plan,\nmonitor, and evaluate their own learning (Sandars &\nCleary 2011).

Students may\nappreciate learning that teams of professionals entrusted with\npeoples\u2019 lives (including airline pilots and well-functioning\nsurgical teams) must regularly debrief about how they are\nfunctioning and to discuss areas where improvement may be\nneeded. Students may also benefit from imagining what\nproblems may arise if people in an airline cockpit or operating\nroom fail to give each other feedback in a way that jeopardizes\nsafety. It has been well shown that practice alone without\ncoaching and feedback does not lead to improvement in\nperformance and the development of expertise (Ericsson et al.\n1993). \u2018\u2018Feedback,\u2019\u2019 which is different from \u2018\u2018evaluation,\u2019\u2019\ninvolves the objective, nonjudgmental description of perfor-\nmance, particularly in relation to the expected standard, and\nshould take place frequently in order to be meaningful and\neffective in facilitating performance improvement. Feedback is\nfor the benefit of its receiver.\nUnderstandably, \u2018\u2018feedback\u2019\u2019 often generates some degree\nof anxiety for students (as well as teachers). Students may\nperceive a lack of time or inapproachability of teachers as\nbarriers to feedback (Milan et al. 2011). We suggest that, given\nthe importance of feedback, students should assume an active\nrole in engaging their teachers in the process of feedback,\nthrough regularly asking for feedback and attending any\nforums where the topic of feedback is discussed.

This discussion should help to build a relationship\nbetween the student and teacher that enables honest commu-\nnication to occur in both directions, for the benefit of the\nlearning environment and (ultimately) future patients.\nConstructive feedback can also be used by teachers to\nenhance active learning strategies.

Also, recent technologies have changed the\nface of learning and allowed learners to learn beyond the\nclassroom.

The Internet, Google, YouTube,\nFacebook, and other Web 2 modalities provided students\nwith a range of learning resources that they can research at any\ntime and add to by sharing materials they have created. In\nfuture, teleconferences may enable students from two\ninstitutes in two different countries to debate issues, discuss\ncases, and share their learning experiences.\nTip 9\nApply knowledge learnt to new problems\nLearners might need to always think about what they are\ndoing. Are they just trying to remember factual knowledge or\nare they using a number of cognitive skills to foster their\nunderstanding by applying knowledge learnt.\nWhy do students need to apply knowledge learnt to new\nproblems?\nApplying knowledge learnt helps students in:\n. Integrating knowledge learnt from several disciplines.\n. Exploring relationships.\n. Practicing a number of cognitive skills such as comparing,\nanalyzing, evaluating, hypothesizing, looking for evidence,\nlinking basic sciences to clinical presentation, questioning,\nexamining possible contributing factors, studying pathogen-\nesis, explaining, identifying gaps, referring to the literature,\nresearching several resources, interpreting findings, and\ndesigning a management plan.\n. Examining the significance of basic sciences in clinical\nsituations and real practices.\n. Enhancing deep understanding.\n. Discovering inadequacies or gaps in their understanding.\nAs future physicians, responsible for dealing with complex\nproblems, students must move beyond simply remembering\nfactual knowledge to applying, or transferring, this knowledge\nto new situations. Deep learning involves the practice of a\nnumber of cognitive skills. During the initial encounter of a\nnew problem, these skills include analyzing, hypothesizing,\nlooking for evidence, comparing, evaluating, questioning,\ninterpreting findings, and examining contributing factors; and\nduring the study of new knowledge, subsequently applied to\nthe problem, these skills include searching the literature,\nstudying pathogenesis, linking basic sciences to the clinical\npresentation, explaining, designing a management plan, and\nidentifying further gaps in knowledge.\nHow can students develop their skills in applying knowl-\nedge to new problems?\nWe recommend that specific process be routinely applied\nin order to insure that knowledge is integrated and applied to\nnew problems in a manner that exercises these aforemen-\ntioned cognitive skills. In a PBL curriculum, students may wish\nto organize their initial discussion of a problem around \u2018\u2018facts,\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018problems,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018hypotheses,\u2019\u2019 (generated from previous knowl-\nedge of disease entities and mechanisms) \u2018\u2018additional\ninformation desired,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018learning issues.\u2019\u2019 When applying\nnewly researched learning issues back to the original problem,\nstudents may wish to use structured tools, such as case\ndiagrams (Guerrero 2001) to integrate knowledge; to specifi-\ncally describe the mechanisms behind clinical symptoms and\ntreatment interventions; and to identify further gaps in\nknowledge (leading to challenges in constructing parts of the\ndiagram).\nStudents should also be encouraged to review their\nperformance as they try to apply knowledge learnt to new\nproblems. They may ask themselves questions such as \u2018\u2018What\ndid I learn from this experience?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Why did I miss to provide\nthe correct answer?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Did I miss understand the question?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018Do I need to read and check my resources again in regard to\nthis particular area?\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018I do remember studying this part but\nthis case is not typical as the examples I studied. What did I\nlearn so far?\u2019\u2019 Such questions could enhance the learner\u2019s\nstrategies and learning outcomes as he/she apply knowledge\nlearnt to solve new problems. In fact, applying knowledge\nlearnt by students to solve new problems is one of the key\nelements for enhancing deep understanding and learning skills\nin general (Metcalfe 2009).\nTip 10\nPractice learning by using simulation\nSimulation involves the replacement of live patient encounters\nwith either standardized patients or technological devices that\nmimic a clinical situation and that may employ mannequins,\nvideogame technology, or full environment approaches\n(similar to cockpit training for pilots).

A recent review by\nOkuda et al. (2009) concluded that learning through the use of\nsimulators may improve medical knowledge, comfort and\ncompetency with procedures, teamwork and communication,\nand (potentially) clinical outcomes. The effectiveness of\nsimulation derives from principles of adult learning, including\nmotivation to solve problems, building on previous experi-\nences, and active involvement in the learning process.\nSimulation is an ideal way to accumulate the required practice\nnecessary to attain expertise, always bearing in mind the\nimportance that this practice requires coaching and feedback,\nor deliberate practice (Ericsson et al. 1993).\nIdeally, students can solidify deep learning through the use\nof simulation. However, there may be limitations to the\noptimal use of simulation resources in medical learning,\nincluding limited availability (depending on institution) or\ninconsistent access, particularly if students in a self-directed\ncurriculum (where there are other competing activities) must\ntake some of the initiative to access resources. Given the\npotential benefits of simulation and the reality that simulation\nwill play a growing role in licensure and certification in\nmedical education (Levine et al. 2012), we strongly recom-\nmend that students, early in their medical training, thoroughly\nfamiliarize themselves with available resources (including\nonline resources, as they become more and more available)\nand maintain discipline in regularly accessing resources that\nare relevant to their curriculum.\nS.

Rather, active engage-\nment and practice allows them to move along a path toward\nmastery. Learning by doing is an educational theory describing\nthe utility of fostering skill development and the learning of\nfacts in the context in which those facts will be used (Schank\net al. 1999). However, in practical terms in medical education,\nthis concept refers to the notion of a learner involvement\nduring the learning process, rather than passive reception.\nThere is evidence from research that students could master\ntheir learning skills when they engage themselves in activities\nthat are sufficiently difficult to promote mental effort, but not\nso difficult that could inhibit their desire to learn (Snelgrove\n2004). Therefore, students could work on tasks that require\nthem to fill in and listen to lectures, research resources, and\nconsult with others to complete these tasks. The tasks may be\nprepared by faculty or embedded in computer learning\nresources which are recommended as a learning resource.\nWhy do students need to learn by doing and service\nlearning?\nLearning by doing and service learning have several\neducational benefits including:\n. Fostering responsibility, accountability, and caring for\nothers.\n. Extending students\u2019 learning from classroom learning to\ncommunity services.\n. Enabling students to develop skills that are less likely\ndeveloped in traditional modes of learning. These skills\ninclude contributing to public safety, environmental protec-\ntion, and public education about common diseases and\nhealthy living habits.\n. Enabling learners to experience the exact meaning of\nlearning and how service learning could add new dimen-\nsions to their learning experience.\nTo complete these tasks, students will need to construct\ninformation collected from multiple learning resources and\npresent their work to their small groups for further discussion.\nThe stimulus for students is to exert greater mental effort and\nthrough a desirable level of task difficulty, students could make\ntheir learning more memorable.\nLearning should not solely in the classroom.Service learning\nprovides an excellent opportunity to students to learn by doing\nas well as develop their skills, knowledge, attitude, and\nprofessional values. Service learning also allows students to\nmeet identified needs in the community and establish links\nbetween the community and academic/clinical learning.\nTip 12\nLearn from patients\nFinally, learning from patients provides students with a\nnumber of educational opportunities that cannot be substi-\ntuted by other teaching modes such as simulation, e-case\npackages, paper-based cases, or clinical skill lab. The aim of\nstudent interaction with patients is not just to learn how to take\na medical history, conduct a clinical examination, or make a\ndiagnosis, it is a unique opportunity to learn how to\ncommunicate effectively with patients, become patient-\ncentered in approach, and build rapport with patients. The\nimportance of these skills is often ignored by students and less\nemphasized in the day-to-day clinical teaching. Therefore,\nlearning from patients in bedside teaching and outpatient\nclinics brings a number of teaching and learning opportunities\n(Wang-Cheng et al. 1989; LaCombe 1997). These can be\nsummarized as follows:\n. Allow students to gain first-hand experience of doctor\u2013\npatient relationships.\n. Enhance the development of patient-centered care. The aim\nis not just how to make a clinical diagnosis, but also how to\naddress the human impact of disease, understand illness,\nand engage the patient to take control of their condition.\n. Enhance students\u2019 competence in taking a medical history\nand examining real patients.\n. Experience the reality of clinical practice and challenges\nthat could face doctors and patients on day-to-day practice\n(e.g., this is completely different from experience with a\nsimulated).\nHow can students maximize their learning from patients?\nBe helpful to patients and attend to their comfort. Do not\nrush.\n. Learn how to use nonverbal cues (both giving and\nreceiving) in your communication.\n. Engage the patient in the discussion, convey empathy to the\npatient\u2019s concerns, and use open-ended questions.\n. Avoid the use of medical jargon, use simple language and in\na direct manner.\n. Be sincere, honest, and interested in talking to the patient\nabout their ideas, emotions, and expectations rather than\njust asking them to listen to their hearts or take a medical\nhistory.\n. Ask permission from the patients before examining them.\nOnce you complete your examination, thank them, and\nleave them to have some rest.\n.

A meta-analysis was conducted of scientifically rigorous experiments \ncomparing the learning outcomes (i.e., performance on memory and/or comprehen -\nsion tests) of students (i.e., college students and/or K-12 students) who read an aca -\ndemic text with or without being asked to highlight important material (i.e., with or \nwithout learner-generated highlighting) or who read an academic text with or with -\nout the important material already being highlighted (i.e., with or without instruc -\ntor-provided highlighting). We found 36 published articles that met these criteria \nranging from the years 1938 to 2019, which generated 85 effect sizes. The results \nshowed that learner-generated highlighting improved memory but not comprehen -\nsion, with average effect sizes of 0.36 and 0.20, respectively; and instructor-provided \nhighlighting improved both memory and comprehension, both with an average effect \nsize of 0.44. Learner-generated highlighting improved learning for college students \nbut not for school students, with average effect sizes of 0.39 and 0.24, respectively; \nand instructor-provided highlighting improved learning for both college and school \nstudents, with average effect sizes of 0.41 and 0.48, respectively. We discuss the \ntheoretical and practical implications of these findings.\nKeywords Meta-analysis\u00a0\u00b7 Highlighting\u00a0\u00b7 Learner-generated highlighting\u00a0\u00b7 \nInstructor-provided highlighting\u00a0\u00b7 Learning strategy\n * H\u00e9ctor R.

How can we help guide the \nlearners\u2019 active cognitive processing during learning in an effort to improve their \nlearning outcome?

The act of highlighting is intended to activate the learners\u2019 \ncognitive process of selecting relevant information for processing in working mem-\nory on its way to storage in long-term memory (Fiorella & Mayer. 2015). We call \nthis approach learner-generated highlighting.\nAnother approach is to design instructional text so that important material is \nalready highlighted. For example, in this instructional design approach, the passage \nis presented to the learner with important parts already highlighted based on the \ninstructional goal of the lesson. With a paper-based or computer-based medium, \nthe important text can be highlighted by adding background color, adding under-\nlining, or using bold or italicized or colored font. Figure\u00a02 provides an example of \nthe steamboat text with important elements in bold font, based on the judgment of \nthe instructional designer. Providing highlighting is intended to efficiently guide \nthe learner\u2019s cognitive process of selecting relevant information for processing in \nworking memory, thereby freeing up cognitive capacity that can be used to men-\ntally organize this important information and integrate it with relevant prior knowl-\nedge (Fiorella & Mayer. 2015, 2016). We call this approach instructor-provided \nhighlighting.\nInstructor-provided highlighting can be considered a component of signaling, \nwhich involves adding cues that guide the learner\u2019s attention to essential material \nin a lesson or to the organization of the essential material (Mayer. 2021; van Cog. \n2022). In particular, instructor-provided highlighting is a type of text-based cue (van \nCog. 2022) or verbal signaling (Mayer. 2021) because it involves guiding attention \nto certain words. Other forms of verbal signaling that can be used in conjunction \nwith highlighting include providing an outline, headings, pointer words (such as, \n\u201cfirst\u2026second\u2026third\u201d), and graphic organizers (Mayer. 2021; Ponce et\u00a0al. 2018a).\nThus, the goal of the present study is to examine what existing published research \nhas to say about the effectiveness of learner-generated highlighting and instructor-\nprovided highlighting on learning from text. In particular, we conduct a meta-anal-\nysis of scientifically rigorous experiments comparing the learning outcomes (i.e., \nperformance on memory and/or comprehension tests) of students (i.e., college stu-\ndents and/or K-12 students) who read an academic text with or without being asked \nto highlight important material (i.e., with or without learner-generated highlighting) \nor who read an academic text with or without the important material already being \nhighlighted (i.e., with or without instructor-provided highlighting).\nOur rationale for choosing to focus on highlighting is that it is a commonly \nused and easy to use learning strategy (Miyatsu et\u00a0al. 2018) or instructional design \nfeature (Mayer. 2021). However, in contrast, highlighting is considered one of the \nleast effective and least valued learning strategies (Dunlosky et\u00a0al. 2013; Fiorella \n& Mayer. 2015, 2016) or instructional design features (Mayer. 2021; Ponce & \nMayer.\u00a02014a). For instance, Dunlosky et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2013) review is particularly criti-\ncal of the usefulness of the highlighting strategy, as they indicate: \u201cmost studies \n991Educational Psychology Review (2022) 34:989\u20131024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3768, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14778a69-c86b-4e05-870e-d2f62d0830ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "14778a69-c86b-4e05-870e-d2f62d0830ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "992", "file_name": "s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1261095, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "553008d9-8440-41f0-bea1-d9941fce5c0c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "992", "file_name": "s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1261095, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "5001d8f626f6c9f527da9587e72a4de4ec490b3ef89c64c10ba66bbd045ec8b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1 3\nhave shown no benefit of highlighting (as it is typically used) over and above \nthe benefit of simply reading, and thus the question concerning the generality of \nthe benefits of highlighting is largely moot\u201d (p. 20).

In examin-\ning this underdog of learning aids, we wish to determine whether there are ways of \nusing highlighting to benefit student learning.\nTheoretical Framework and\u00a0Hypotheses\nWe ground our search in generative learning theory (Fiorella & Mayer. 2015; \nWittrock. 1989) and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer. 2021), \nwhich posit that active learning occurs when learners engage in appropriate cog-\nnitive processing during learning. As shown in the left columns of Table\u00a01 and \nTable\u00a02, three cognitive processes required for meaningful learning from text are \nselecting (i.e., attending to the relevant information in a text and transferring that \ninformation to working memory), organizing (i.e., mentally organizing the incoming \ninformation into a coherent cognitive representation in working memory), and inte-\ngrating (i.e., connecting incoming information into working memory with relevant \nprior knowledge activated from long-term memory). When the learner engages in \nnone of these processes, the learning outcome is no learning, indicated by poor per-\nformance on tests of memory and comprehension. When the learner engages mainly \nin selecting, the learning outcome is rote learning, indicated by good performance \non tests of memory but not tests of comprehension. When the learner engages in all \nthree cognitive processes during learning, the learning outcome is meaningful learn-\ning, reflected in good performance on both memory and comprehension tests.\nConsider what happens when the learner does or does not engage in learner-gen-\nerated highlighting, as summarized in the top of Table\u00a01. The middle column of \nTable\u00a01 shows how learner-generated highlighting relates to these three processes. \nFirst, learner-generated highlighting activates the cognitive process of selecting \nbecause the learner must search for the important information in a text that needs \nto be highlighted, but processing capacity is limited, so when the learner uses too \nmuch processing capacity on the cognitive process of selecting there may insuf-\nficient capacity available for organizing and integrating. Thus, as shown in the \nright column of Table\u00a01, we predict that student-generated highlighting will yield \nimprovements in tests of memory (which reflect the fruits of engaging in selecting) \nbut not in tests of comprehension (which reflect the fruits of engaging in all three \ncognitive processes; Hypothesis 1). Second, if the learner is inexperienced in high-\nlighting, the learner may select unimportant material information and will attempt \nto engage in organizing and integrating with that unimportant material. Thus as \nshown in the right side of Table\u00a01, we predict that student-generated highlighting \nwill yield improvements for college students (who presumably have developed some \nproficiency in highlighting important information) but not for K-12 students (who \npresumably have no developed adequate proficiency in highlighting; Hypothesis 2). \nThird, if the learner is inefficient in highlighting, the learner will select unimpor-\ntant information and will attempt to engage in organizing and integrating with that \n993Educational Psychology Review (2022) 34:989\u20131024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3530, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9922c4c9-95c8-4b14-82c6-4967230b2443": {"__data__": {"id_": "9922c4c9-95c8-4b14-82c6-4967230b2443", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "994", "file_name": "s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1261095, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff0053ee-76b6-4623-b5e8-f750c703e3cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "994", "file_name": "s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1261095, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "5c3fb2396dd1032e0eb1d019de4c50b592d85e781440182b06d8d56a9954ddf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1 3\nunimportant material.

Thus, as shown in the right side of Table\u00a02 , we predict \ninstructor-provided highlighting will lead to improvements in both memory (reflecting \nthe role of selecting) and comprehension tests (reflecting the impact of all three cogni-\ntive processes; Hypothesis 6). Second, instructor-provided highlighting overcomes the \nproblem that inexperienced students are likely to select the wrong material, so we pre-\ndict that instructor-provided highlighting will be helpful for both college students and \nK-12 students, as shown in the right column of Table\u00a02 (Hypothesis 7).\nIt could be argued that instructor-provided highlighting inhibits the learner\u2019s \nselecting process, because the learner does not have to decide what is important. \nIn other words, it could be argued that when selecting is done for the learner, this \ndeprives the learner of the benefits of generative learning. This analysis makes \nsense if we assume that learners have sufficient cognitive capacity to allow them to \nengage in selecting, organizing, and integrating processes during learning. In con-\ntrast, when learners must devote a large portion of their limited processing capacity \nto deciding what is important in a lesson (i.e., selecting), we assume that they may \nnot have sufficient capacity remaining for engaging in the processes that are central \nto deep learning\u2014mentally organizing that information and relating it to relevant \nprior knowledge. Additionally, some learners may select inappropriate information, \nwhich eliminates the benefits of engaging in organizing and integrating processes. \nThus, our general prediction is that learner-generated highlighting will improve per-\nformance both on memory tests (which reflect the learner engaging in the selecting \nprocess during learning) and comprehension tests (which reflect the learner engag-\ning in organizing and integrating processes during learning).\nMethod\nWe searched and examined published research on learner-generated highlighting \nand instructor-provided highlighting, focusing on studies that reported experi-\nments with a control group, measured learning outcomes, such as performance \non memory and/or comprehension tests, and involved college students or K-12 \nstudents as participants.\nInclusion and\u00a0Exclusion Criteria\nSeven criteria were considered for the selection of studies:\n1.

These searches generated 1,523 \nrecords. After reviewing the titles of each study, we concluded that 1,471 records \nwere not related to the highlighting strategy. Thus, 52 studies were analyzed; we \nfound 32 duplicate studies, adding 20 new studies to the previous 86 references, \ntotalizing thus 106 studies.

Two of these studies were duplicates of the previous selections.\nThe literature search included all studies available through March 2021 and gen-\nerated a total of 143 unique studies selected for detailed screening. From this list, \neight studies were not considered in detail for the following reasons: two were not \nfound, two were in German, one was a book chapter, and three were books. We clas-\nsified the remaining 135 studies according to whether they were experimental or \nnot, discarding 19 studies. Additionally, 43 studies were not considered since they \nfocused on other learning or study strategies. The remaining 73 articles were thor-\noughly reviewed by isolating the data needed to compute effect sizes. We computed \neffect sizes for memory and comprehension tests. Studies that included only other \ntypes of tests, such as reading speed, vocabulary, and frequency of text marking, \nwere excluded from the meta-analysis, resulting in 10 studies being removed.\nFifteen studies with insufficient data to compute effect sizes and four studies with-\nout a control group (i.e., read-only group) were also excluded. Finally, we excluded \nthree more studies that tested comprehension from diagrams and not from texts, and \nother five studies that were postgraduate dissertations rather than published articles. \nConsequently, 36 studies were considered in the meta-analysis. Figure\u00a03 presents a \nsummary of the literature search strategies based on the PRISMA flowchart (Moher \net\u00a0al. 2009). From these studies, 28 articles examined learner-generated highlighting \nand/or instructor-provided highlighting (four studies included both type of experi-\nments) (see Table\u00a03). Additionally, 9 studies included the use of highlighting in \ncombination with an additional activity such as training on how to use highlighting, \nreviewing the highlighted material after some time, or combining highlighting with \nanother learning strategy such as notetaking or graphic organizers (see Table\u00a04); one \nof these studies was also included in Table\u00a03. Additionally, some treatment groups \nwere analyzed independently since the objective was to observe the effects of irrel-\nevant or inappropriate highlighting on learning; 4 studies were included in this cat-\negory (see Table\u00a05), and all were parts of studies identified in Table\u00a03.\nData Feature Coding\nEach experimental treatment described in the studies was coded using the follow-\ning descriptor variables: experimental design (i.e., learner-generated highlighting or \ninstructor-provided highlighting), learning outcome measure (i.e., memory or com-\nprehension), and educational level (i.e., college or school).\nTo compute effect sizes, we used posttest data (sample size, mean, and standard \ndeviation) for the control group and each experimental group (some studies exam-\nined more than one type of highlighting).

If the F value was reported for ANOVA \nwith three or more groups, and the means and sample sizes for each group were \nreported, we used the procedure described by Lipsey and Wilson (2001) to com-\npute the effect size for each possible comparison between control and experimental \ngroups. To compute Hedge\u2019s g and its standard error (SE), we used the following \nformulas (Borenstein et\u00a0al. 2009): g\n \n=\n \nJ x d,  Vg = J2  x Vd, and SEg = sqrt(Vg), where \nJ\n \n=\n \n(1-(3/(4(n1 + n2  \u2013 2) \u2013 1)))), and n1 and n2  correspond to the sample sizes of the \ncontrol and experimental groups.\nSeveral studies reported data from two or more independent treatment groups. \nFor example, Simard (2009) experimented with different types of typographical \ncues for highlighting which included one control group and seven treatment sub-\ngroups. We followed Borenstein et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2009) recommendations and computed \na composite effect size for each study by performing a fixed-effect meta-analysis \non the subgroups, where the mean effect size is the sum of the products of each \neffect size multiplied by its weight (i.e., the inverse of its variance) divided by \nthe sum of the weights. The variance was computed as the reciprocal of the sum \nof the weights and the standard error as the square root of the variance. The fol-\nlowing studies were treated in this way (see Table\u00a01): Klare et\u00a0al. (1955), Crouse \nand Idstein (1972) (Exp. 1 only), Leicht and Cashen (1972), Rickards and \nAugust (1975), Lorch Jr. et\u00a0al. 1995) (Exp. 1 only), and Simard (2009). Addi-\ntionally, to compute average effect sizes for educational level (i.e., college and \nK-12), we computed a combined effect size for each study or experiment within \nthe study that reported memory and comprehension test scores for the same par-\nticipants. The following procedure was used (Borenstein et\u00a0al. 2009): First, the \naverage between effect sizes for memory and comprehension was computed and \nsecond, the new variance was computed as the sum of both variances plus twice \nthe correlation between memory and compression scores by the square roots of \neach variance; and the result was divided by four. We assumed a 0.5 correlation \nbetween memory and comprehension scores for all studies in this condition (De \nRidder. 2000; Lege. 2019; Mathews. 1938; Ponce & Mayer. 2014a; Ponce et\u00a0al. \n2018a).\nA random-effects analysis method with a restricted maximum likelihood esti-\nmator (REML) was used to carry out the meta-analyses (Borenstein et\u00a0al. 2009). \nThe quantity I2  or level of heterogeneity was used to assess the consistency of \nthe meta-analyses\u2019 results. Deeks et\u00a0al. 2020) offer the following rough guides \nfor the interpretation of the I2  statistic: (1) 0% to 40% might not be significant; \n(2) 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; (3) 50% to 90% may rep-\nresent substantial heterogeneity; and (4) 75% to 100% considerable heterogene-\nity. The authors argue that the interpretation of this statistic depends on several \nfactors such as magnitude and direction of effects, number of studies included in \nthe meta-analysis, and strength of evidence for heterogeneity.\nPrediction intervals were used to estimate the dispersion of effect sizes. \nBorenstein (2019) indicates that confidence interval and prediction interval are \ndifferent types of statistical indices. The confidence interval shows the preci-\nsion of the estimated mean effect, whereas the prediction interval shows the dis-\npersion of effects or how broadly the effect size differs across populations.

As indicated by Deeks et\u00a0al. (2020), one or two studies that \nconflict with the rest of the studies can generate heterogeneity. Effect sizes were \ntransformed to Z-scores; outliers with a Z value lower than -3.3 or larger than \n3.3 were windsorized by adjusting their values to the next-lowest or next-largest \neffect size in the distribution, as used in previous meta-analyses (Castro-Alonso \net\u00a0al. 2019).\nWe used the JASP software (JASP-TEAM. 2020) to carry out each of the \nmeta-analyses included in this study. Moderator analyses were conducted for \nlearning outcome and educational level measures using subgroup analyses with \na mixed-effects model and a pool within-group estimates of tau-squared (Boren-\nstein. 2019). The subgroup analyses and publication bias analysis were per-\nformed with the Meta-Essentials tool for meta-analysis (Suurmond et\u00a0al. 2017).\nResults\nA total of 85 effect sizes were generated from the data recollected from the 36 arti-\ncles, as shown in Tables\u00a03, 4, and 5. Sixty effect sizes were associated with learner-\ngenerated highlighting and instructor-provided highlighting (see Table\u00a0 3), which \nwere reduced to 46 effect sizes after applying the procedure indicated in the methods \nsection to the six studies that included more than one treatment conditions. Addi-\ntionally, nineteen effect sizes were related to experimental treatments that combined \nhighlighting with another learning activity (see Table\u00a04), and six effect sizes were \ncomputed from experimental treatments that examined the effects of inappropriate \ntext highlighting (see Table\u00a05).\nTo test our hypotheses, we conducted independent meta-analyses with these \neffect sizes separated by learner-generated highlighting or instructor-provided high-\nlighting as presented in Tables\u00a06, 7, and 8. The decision to conduct independent \nmeta-analyses was based on the hypotheses stated and the objective of this study\u2014\nto identify under what conditions highlighting support learning.\nThe reporting of the results of the meta-analyses was based on Borenstein\u2019s \n(2019) recommendations. We will use Hattie\u2019s (2009) meta-analysis findings for \ninterpreting effect sizes in education, indicating that an effect size Cohen\u2019s d\n \n=\n \n0.40 \nis the \u201chinge point\u201d at which an educational intervention shows a greater than aver-\nage impact on student achievement.\nTables\u00a06, 7, and 8 present the results of the meta-analyses.

Table\u00a07 presents the results for \nlearner-generated highlighting with added features such as using highlighting in \ncombination with another strategy.\nDoes learner\u2011generated highlighting improve learning?\nHypothesis 1 predicts that when students use highlighting as learning strategy, they will \nshow improvements in tests of memory but not in tests of comprehension. The second \nrow of Table\u00a06 presents the standardized mean difference for tests of memory, with \ng +\n  =\n 0.36 and confidence inter\nval between 0.08 and 0.64. The Z value for testing the \nnull hypothesis was 2.489 with p =\n 0.013. Conseq\nuently, on average, learners who used \nhighlighting as learning strategy (experimental groups) improved memory (e.g., recall of \nmain ideas) by 0.36 standard deviations compared to learners who only read or studied \nthe text (control groups). This mean effect size is within Hattie\u2019s \u201chinge point\u201d range, \nindicating that, on average, highlighting as a learning strategy has a significant and rele-\nvant impact on supporting students to remember important ideas in the learning material.\nEffect size variation across studies, Q(1,11)\n \n=\n \n54.3, p <\n 0.001, \nindicates that the \nactual effect size is not identical in all the studies. The I2  statistic equal to 79% reflects \na substantial level of heterogeneity among the studies. The T2  statistics was 0.178, and \nthe corresponding standard deviation T was 0.421. The 95% prediction interval was \n-0.63 to 1.35, which tells us that in 95% of all populations comparable to the anal-\nysis, the actual effect will fall in this range. It reflects the uncertainty in the overall \neffect size if a new study is included in the meta-analysis. For example, some studies \nincluded in this meta-analysis found that highlighting as learning strategy is not effec-\ntive (reflected in negative effect sizes) (Mathews. 1938; Rickards & Denner. 1979) but \nother studies found that highlighting is a very effective learning strategy (reflected in \npositive and large effect sizes) (Fass & Schumacher. 1978; Rickards & August. 1975), \nso it is expected that new studies will fall within the prediction interval.\nHypothesis 1 also predicts that when students use highlighting as learning strat-\negy, they will not show improvements in comprehension tests. The third row of \nTable\u00a06 presents the standardized mean difference in tests of comprehension, with \ng\n +\n  =\n 0.20, confidence inter\nval between -0.08 and 0.48, and Z value equal to 1.421 \n(p\n = 0\n.155).

The \nresults from the meta-analyses show that, on average, when learners generated \ntheir own highlighting, they improved on tests of memory but not on tests of \ncomprehension, with average effect sizes of 0.36 and 0.20, respectively (Hypoth-\nesis 1). When learners received high-quality highlighting, they improved on tests \nof memory and comprehension, both with an average effect size of 0.44 (Hypoth-\nesis 6). Based on Hattie\u2019s (2009) interpretation of effect sizes in education, these \nare significant findings; it can be concluded that, on average, highlighting shows \na greater than average impact on student learning, particularly when it is imple-\nmented as an instructional design feature.\nThe results from the meta-analyses also demonstrated that when college students \nused highlighting as a learning strategy, they benefited significantly but K-12 stu-\ndents did not, with effect sizes of 0.39 and 0.24, respectively (Hypothesis 2). These \nfindings demonstrate that less experienced learners may not know what to high-\nlight, so training will be more necessary for younger students. Rickards and Denner \n(1979) argue that children compared with more mature students are still developing \nmeta-comprehension skills so such deficiency may lead them to select details rather \nthan main ideas to highlight. In a more recent review, Miyatsu et\u00a0al. (2018) also have \nnoted that students who are younger than college age generally do not benefit from \nlearner-generated highlighting. Studies with K-12 students on highlighting have \nemployed expository texts; however, children are more familiar with narrative texts, \nwhich present important differences with expository texts not only in terms of con-\ntent but also in their organizational structure. Such unfamiliarity with text structure \nis an important limitation for the appropriate use of highlighting as learning strategy \n(Meyer & Poon.\u00a02001; Ponce et\u00a0al. 2018a).\nRegarding instructor-provided highlighting, this meta-analysis reveals that when \nhigh-quality highlighting is provided, on average, both college and K-12 students ben-\nefit greatly, with effect sizes of 0.41 and 0.48, respectively (Hypothesis 7). Training on \nhow to use highlighting as a learning strategy showed encouraging results. Despite the \nsmall number of studies, it shows that training has a significant and higher than aver-\nage effect size on learning from text, with an average effect size of 1.02 (Hypothesis \n3). As one of the studies demonstrated (Schnell & Rocchio. 1974), even less than 2\u00a0h \nof training can have a considerable effect on learning from texts (g \n=\n \n0.86).\nThe results from combining highlighting with another learning strategy such as note-\ntaking or graphic organizers were demonstrated to be very effective, with an average \neffect size of 0.82 (Hypothesis 4). This average effect size represents more than twice the \nlargest average effect sizes observed for highlighting as single learning strategy (i.e., col-\nlege students, g +\n  =\n 0.39). When highlighting is used in conjunction wit\nh another learn-\ning strategy such as notetaking, graphic organizer, or post-question, the effectiveness of \nsuch combinations is particularly high, as demonstrated by the few studies in this area. \n1018 Educational Psychology Review (2022) 34:989\u20131024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3502, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "563aa3e3-8225-46c6-9f97-7f179782691c": {"__data__": {"id_": "563aa3e3-8225-46c6-9f97-7f179782691c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1019", "file_name": "s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1261095, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ebf06c0b-5424-4526-8aee-75550d314351", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1019", "file_name": "s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1261095, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "4f2a3a73c272bacf3e80f23e110ae0062c85470a96c00bca112614784b7248df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1 3\nFor example, Ponce et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2018a) study showed that asking students, first, to highlight \ntext, and second, to take notes or fill-in a graphic organizer is much more effective than \nasking students to either read the text or highlight relevant ideas in the text.\nHowever, asking students to review their highlighting after some time was not \nmore effective than reading the learning material, with an average effect size of -0.06 \n(Hypothesis 5). The experimental studies examined in this meta-analysis asked stu-\ndents to review the highlighted material one week after the students highlighted such \nmaterial. The main variations were in the time spent reviewing or studying the high-\nlighting texts, ranging from 4.5\u00a0min to 15\u00a0min (see Table\u00a04 for more details). Failure \nto highlight relevant information (e.g., main ideas) from text can lead students to \nreview their own inappropriate or irrelevant study material (Peterson. 1991).\nFinally, experimental treatments designed to examine the effects of inappropriate \nhighlighting demonstrated the detrimental consequences of this type of highlighting \non learning, with an average effect size of -0.70. This finding informs instructional \ndesigners about the appropriate use of the highlighting technique when developing \ninstructional material to support learning, such as choosing to highlight main ideas \nand/or organizational elements in texts.\nTheoretical Contributions\nThis study was grounded in generative learning theory (Fiorella & Mayer. 2015; \nWittrock. 1989) and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer. 2021) \nwhich postulate that active learning occurs when learners engage in appropriate cog-\nnitive processing during learning. As predicted by these theories, without training \non what to highlight, learner-generated highlighting activates mainly the cognitive \nprocess of selecting. This was confirmed by this meta-analysis; on average, learner-\ngenerated highlighting showed improvements in memory tests but not in comprehen-\nsion tests. It demonstrates that the type of learning that emerges is mainly confined \nto superficial learning in which learners tend to memorize a list of facts rather than \na deeper elaboration of the learning material. Similarly, this meta-analysis supports \nthe prediction that learner-generated highlighting works mainly for college students. \nK-12 students may not know what to highlight or have less experience with this \ntechnique, such as not knowing how to distinguish main ideas from secondary ideas \nor how to identify the organizational structure of text (e.g., cause-and-effect). On the \nhand, when less experienced students receive training on what to highlight, it leads \nto the activation of selecting, organizing, integrating cognitive processes. Learners \nlearn what to search in a text that needs to be highlighted, activating thus the select-\ning cognitive process and leaving cognitive capacity available for the higher-level \nprocesses of organizing and integrating.\nAsking students to highlight text in conjunction with a second strategy, such \nas constructing a graphic organizer or notetaking, promotes deeper processing of \nthe text that fosters deeper comprehension of the text, as demonstrated by better \nscores on memory and comprehension. As predicted, the highlighted information \nis selected and stored in working memory for further processing; these strategies \n1019Educational Psychology Review (2022) 34:989\u20131024", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3462, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ab06ddc-3339-4d04-964c-d8b70b9cb45b": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ab06ddc-3339-4d04-964c-d8b70b9cb45b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1020", "file_name": "s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1261095, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d8fc6ebe-f705-4ca0-bbd8-78850f4b5789", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1020", "file_name": "s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/s10648-021-09654-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1261095, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "a053f1ad3568ef51a1ca1ca39a90b3e82b3fad075cba70159e5170212e508fce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1 3\nprovide structures to organize the selected ideas, allowing the construction of a men-\ntal model of the text and integration with previous knowledge.\nThis meta-analysis also confirms that when learners receive high-quality high-\nlighting, learner\u2019s selecting processes are conducted with high efficiency, and there-\nfore, cognitive capacity is available for the higher-level processes of organizing and \nintegrating, as shown by improvements in learning by college and K-12 students in \nboth memory and comprehension measures.\nPractical contributions\nInstruction on how to use the highlighting strategy can be crucial to improve its impact on \nlearning for less experienced learners. Some recommendations from the reviewed articles \nin this study are the following. During instruction, instructors should provide demonstra-\ntion and practice using instructor-based models of effective and non-effective highlighting \ntechniques. More structured and instructor-based methods of highlighting are more bene-\nficial than non-structured or non-instructed approaches. A structured-instruction approach \nincludes discrimination practice on how to differentiate main ideas from secondary or \nsupporting ideas, or how to identify cues in the text that show its organizational struc-\nture (e.g., sequence, cause-and-effect, or comparison types of texts), and shows students \nexamples of appropriate and inappropriate highlighting, and offers relevant feedback. \nOne or two hours of instructions have demonstrated sufficient to observe improvement in \nmemory measures (Hayati & Shariatifar. 2009; Leutner et\u00a0al. 2007; Schnell & Rocchio. \n1974). Learners and instructional designers should highlight content relatively sparingly \nto observe improvements in learning from text (Lorch et\u00a0al. Jr.\u00a01995). If too much text has \nbeen highlighted, learners become desensitized to highlighting, which can harm learners\u2019 \nability to remember relevant ideas from text (Lege. 2019).\nThe combined use of highlighting with notetaking, graphic organizers, or self-regula-\ntory cognitive processes has also proved effective in improving student learning (Leutner \net\u00a0al. 2007; Ponce et\u00a0al. 2018a). Therefore, a practical recommendation could be to teach \nstudents how to highlight by identifying relevant information in combination with the \nuse of graphic organizers. In this case, the structure of the graphic organizer (e.g., com-\npare-and-contrast organizer) can be used to identify key information in the text.\nFuture Research and\u00a0Limitations\nGiven that learner-generated highlighting was not very helpful for K-12 students, \nthere is a need to understand other factors that can be moderating the appropri-\nate use of highlighting, such as learner\u2019s reading comprehension level, vocabulary \nknowledge, lack of training on highlighting, and previous training on other reading \nstrategies (e.g., notetaking and questioning). Will continued exposure to high-qual-\nity highlighted text improve learner-generated highlighting?\nPrimary school students involved in the experiments were fifth and sixth grad-\ners only. Will younger students benefit from highlighting text or studying high-\nlighted text?

(1980), Simard (2009), and Ponce \net\u00a0al. (2018a) found positive effects with sixth graders. Are these effects replicable \nwith learners from different grades and school contexts?\nMost texts used in the experiments with highlighting were expository texts, \nfocusing on the content of the text (e.g., highlighting main ideas, principles, or \ndetails). Previous research indicated that a critical element in helping learners to \ncomprehend expository texts is to work not only on its content but also on its inter-\nnal organization or structure (e.g., cause-and-effect or compare-and-contrast text \ntypes) (Cook & Mayer. 1988; Fiorella & Mayer. 2016; Meyer & Poon. 2001; Ponce \n& Mayer. 2014b). Consequently, a possible research avenue is to examine whether \nhighlighting helps learners to recognize text structures and at the same time support \nthe comprehension of its content (e.g., highlighting keywords that characterize text \nstructures).\nAdditionally, narrative texts (e.g., stories and tales) are extensively used in ele-\nmentary school, and instruction of its content and internal structures (i.e., story \ngrammar) have been shown to improve memory and comprehension of this type \nof text (National Institute of Child Health & Human Development. 2000). Should \ninstruction on highlighting start with narrative texts before teaching how to highlight \nexpository texts? Are the skills developed to identify story structures transferable to \nexpository text?\nMore research is also needed to explore the effects of using highlighting in com-\nbination with other strategies before, during, and after reading. Some combinations \nhave shown to be effective such as highlighting plus notetaking or highlighting plus \ngraphic organizer (Ponce et\u00a0al. 2018a), but others have proven less effective, such as \ninstructor-provided highlighting plus content questions (Rickards & Denner. 1979).\nFinally, a potential limitation of this study is that we focused on peer-reviewed \nstudies; postgraduate theses and unpublished research studies were not included in \nthis meta-analysis.\nFunding This w ork was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo de\u00a0Chile under \nGrant FONDECYT #1200803.\nReferences\nAmer, A.

The study-phase retrieval hypothesis predicts that, under these\ncircumstances, expanding intervals between repetitions will promote the greatest likelihood that the\nparticipant will be reminded of previous occurrences of the item, thus leading to a benefit for subsequent\nrecall. In the present article, participants studied vocabulary pairs that were repeated according to one of\nthree schedules. In the expanding schedule, pairs were presented on days 1, 2 and 13; in the uniform\nschedule, on days 1, 7 and 13; and in the contracting schedule, on days 1, 12 and 13. Cued-recall was\nassessed after a retention interval (RI) of 2, 6 or 13 days. Consistent with predictions, the expanding\nschedule generally led to better performance than the other schedules. However, further analyses\nsuggested that the benefit of an expanding schedule may be greater when the RI is longer.\nKeywords: Distributed practice; Spacing effect; Long-term retention; Expanding schedule; Repetition.\nIf one wants to learn and retain information, a\ncommon strategy is to practice the information\nseveral times over a period of several days. How\nshould these learning episodes be scheduled in\ntime in order to maximise later memory? A well-\nknown phenomenon is the effect of distributed\npractice (see Delaney, Verkoeijen, & Spirgel,\n2010; Toppino & Gerbier, 2014, for recent re-\nviews). Subsequent memory benefits more from\nrepetitions that are separated by a long inter-study\ninterval (ISI; i.e., spaced condition) than by a\nshort or null ISI (i.e., massed condition). A\nmajority of studies on distributed practice have\nbeen conducted over a short period of time; that\nis, acquisition and tests were performed during the\nsame experimental session (see Cepeda, Pashler,\nVul, Wixted, & Rohrer,2006). They also mostly\nexamined the effect of two learning trials and/or\ntest trials (e.g., Cepeda, Vul, Rohrer, Wixted, &\nPashler, 2008). In this article, we focus on situa-\ntions in which verbal items are practiced by means\nof multiple repeated presentations that are spaced\nover several days (i.e., long timescale).\nThe classical procedure consists of subjects\npracticing material through a fixed number of\nrepeated trials (e.g., Landauer & Bjork, 1978).\nAddress correspondence to: Emilie Gerbier, Laboratoire EMC, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 2, 5 Avenue Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France, 69676 Bron\nCedex, France.

An expanding schedule consists of\nsuccessive repetitions separated by ISIs of increas-\ning duration; a uniform schedule involves success-\nive ISIs of equal duration; and a contracting\nschedule consists of successive ISIs of decreasing\nduration. The retention interval (RI) is the time\nbetween the last learning session and the final\nmemory test. SeeFigure 1 for a schematic\nrepresentation.\nAccording to the study-phase retrieval hypo-\nthesis (Benjamin & Tullis,2010; Thios & D\u2019Agos-\ntino, 1976; Toppino & Gerbier,2014), an item\u2019s\nrepetition is helpful for later memory only if it\nsuccessfully triggers the retrieval of the memory\nfor a previous occurrence of the item. In the case\nof repeated study trials, the study-phase retrieval\nconsists of the subject being reminded of the\nprevious episode(s) in which a given item was\nencountered. The more difficult or unlikely the\nreminding of an item, the better its later recall\n(Benjamin & Tullis,2010). Thus, according to the\nstudy-phase retrieval or reminding model, as\nthe lag or ISI between repetitions grows longer,\nthe probability of reminding decreases, while the\nrepetition\u2019s potential for improving later memory\nincreases (provided the item was reminded).\nFrom this theoretical perspective, expanding\nschedules should benefit subsequent memory\nrelative to uniform and contracting schedules\nwhen conditions make study-phase retrieval diffi-\ncult. The long initial ISI characteristic of uniform\nand contracting schedules will make reminding\nunlikely and minimise the benefits of repetition.\nHowever, the short initial ISI of expanding\nschedules should increase the likelihood that the\nsecond presentation will remind the learner of the\nfirst occurrence, and the resulting strengthening\neffect should increase the likelihood of successful\nreminding after the longer ISIs that are to follow.\nIf study-phase retrieval is too easy, uniform\nschedules, and even contracting schedules, may\nyield memory performance that equals or exceeds\nthat of expanding schedules. Under these circum-\nstances, the predicted advantage of the expanding\nschedule in terms of successful study-phase re-\ntrieval will be minimised and possibly offset by\nthe advantage of longer initial ISIs in the other\nschedules.\nEncoding variability provides an alternative\ntheoretical perspective on distributed practice. In\nthis view, context, both external (i.e., components\nof the perceived environment) and internal (i.e.,\nmood, current thoughts, etc.), influences how\nmaterial is processed and encoded. An item\nrepeated within the same context will be either\nprocessed in the same way or linked to the same\ncomponents in memory. Items in memory are\nassumed to have a greater chance of being\nretrieved subsequently if they are encoded in\nvarious contexts, because they will benefit from\nmore retrieval cues. It is supposed that the\ncontext gradually fluctuates over time, such that\nwidely spaced repetitions will benefit from more\ndiverse context and encoding than closely spaced\nitems. Although these principles provide an\naccount of the classic spacing effect (i.e., improved\nperformance as a function of an increasing ISIs), it\nis less clear that they apply to differences among\nschedules of spaced practice. When schedules are\nmanipulated, the mean ISI is the same in all\nschedule conditions and, therefore, longer ISIs\nare compensated by shorter ISIs within a given\nschedule. In some cases, as in the present article,\nexpanding and contracting schedules have ident-\nical degrees of spacing, with only the order of\npresentation varying. Thus, it is unclear why\ngeneral differences among schedules would be\nexpected. However, as we will discuss later, a\nsophisticated form of encoding variability pro-\nposed by Glenberg (1976, 1979) predicts that\ndifferences between expanding and contracting\nschedules may depend on the RI.\nAnother theoretical approach to distributed\npractice effects emphasises deficient-processing\nmechanisms. At a general level, the second pre-\nsentation of a repeated item may not be pro-\ncessed fully if it occurs too soon after the first\npresentation. This reduces the total amount of\nprocessing devoted to the item, impairing sub-\nsequent memory performance. Although several\ndifferent hypotheses have been proposed to\naccount for deficient processing, they typically\nrely on transient processes such as short-term\nstorage or priming (see Toppino & Gerbier,2014,\nfor a recent review).

However, when spacing intervals\nare short (varying in the range of seconds),\ndeficient processing mechanisms might reduce\nthe effectiveness of short ISIs at the beginning\nof expanding schedules and at the end of con-\ntracting schedules, perhaps contributing in some\ncases to the superiority of uniform schedules\nwhich might be less affectedby deficient processing.\nAs we noted earlier, most of the research on\nschedules has used a short time frame in which\nthe entire experiment is completed in a single\nsession, with ISIs and RIs measured in seconds\nand minutes. The results have been mixed. Most\nof the studies have varied the way in which test-\nbased reviews are distributed. Some found an\nadvantage for an expanding schedule (e.g., Cull,\nShaughnessy, & Zechmeister,1996; Landauer &\nBjork, 1978). Others did not (e.g., Cull, 2000),\nand still others found an advantage for uniform\nschedules, particularly when the RI was long\n(e.g., Karpicke & Roediger,2007; Logan &\nBalota, 2008; see also Maddox, Balota, Coane,\n& Duchek, 2011; Storm, Bjork, & Storm,2010).\nFewer experiments have investigated the effect of\nschedules on learning rather than on reviews by\npresenting repeated study trials (i.e., without\ntests). No difference due to schedules has been\nfound (e.g., Cull,2000, Exp. 1), raising a question\nof whether scheduling effects involving test-based\nreviews can be generalised to learning from\nrepeated studying.\nTwo potential problems with varying schedules\nwithin a short time frame are that study-phase\nretrieval may be relatively good across the full\nrange of ISIs used and that the effect of short ISIs\nsuch as the early spacing intervals in expanding\nschedules may be affected by transient processes\nthat lead to deficient processing (see Toppino &\nGerbier,2014). Both of these possibilities would\nreduce any advantage that otherwise might be\ngained with an expanding schedule. Finally, the\nshort time frame may have limited implications\nfor educational applications that often unfold\nover longer time periods.\nThe above problems are minimised or elimi-\nnated when schedules are investigated under\nconditions in which ISIs and RIs are measured\nin terms of days and weeks. The time frame is\neducationally relevant; study-phase retrieval is\nrelatively difficult; and the influence of transient\nprocesses is avoided. To the best of our know-\nledge, nine experiments (reported in six articles)\nhave used this approach to study verbal memory.\nTheir procedure and results are described in\nTable 1.\nTsai (1927, Exps. 2 and 3) and Gerbier and\nKoenig ( 2012, Exp. 1) obtained results that\nseemed to support the superiority of expanding\nschedules. In contrast, studies by Cull ( 2000,\nExps. 3 and 4), K\u00fcpper-Tetzel, Kapler, and\nWiseheart (2014) and Kang, Lindsey, Mozer,\nand Pashler (2014) failed to obtain an advantage\nfor expanding schedules. These two sets of studies\nvary in many ways, but the extent and the type of\ninitial training seemed noteworthy. For the most\npart, studies that supported the effectiveness of\nexpanding schedules presented participants with a\nlimited amount of training, involving study trials\nonly (no practice tests). In contrast, the studies\nthat failed to support the superiority of expanding\nschedules typically gave participants extensive\ntraining in the first session that included practice\ntests, a particularly potent form of training that\nproduces long-lasting retention. Two of the latter\nexperiments (Kang et al.,2014; K\u00fcpper-Tetzel\net al., 2014) also used extensive training with\npractice tests in subsequent sessions.

In a subsequent laboratory-based\nexperiment, Gerbier and Koenig (2012, Exp. 2)\nfound no difference between the expanding and\nuniform schedules, with the two schedules yield-\ning virtually identical performance. A possible\nexplanation for the discrepancy is that, in an\nattempt to assess study-phase retrieval in Exp. 2,\nGerbier and Koenig required that participants\nmake a recognition decision on all pairs during\nthe study sessions. This may have induced a\nhigher level of study-phase retrieval, reducing\nthe advantage of the expanding schedule over\nthe other schedules. The conclusions seems to be\nthat an unambiguous advantage for expanding\nschedules has yet to be reported when learning\ntrials involving repeated study are distributed\nover a long time frame.\nThe primary purpose of the present research\nwas to assess the effectiveness of expanding,\nuniform and contracting schedules over a long\ntime frame, while minimising or eliminating the\nfactors that rendered previous findings equivocal.\nBecause our interest centred on how the sche-\ndules affect learning, no separate original learning\nsession was conducted before the schedules were\ninstituted as Cull (2000), Kang et al. (2014) and\nK\u00fcpper-Tetzel et al. (2014) had done. Critical\npairs were presented exactly three times and\ndiffered in terms of how their second and third\npresentations were distributed over a period of 13\ndays. Also, each repetition involved a study\nopportunity without any explicit test such as the\nrecognition test that was used by Gerbier and\nKoenig (2012, Exp. 2) which might affect parti-\ncipants\u2019 degree of spontaneous study-phase\nretrieval.\nThe secondary aim of the present research was\nto introduce variations in the duration of the RI\nto investigate whether the expected advantage of\nthe expanding schedule would generalise across\ndifferent RIs. We conducted three replications of\nan experiment, differing only with respect to the\nduration of the RI. Previous research in which\nrepeated practice involved only study sessions\nused relatively short RIs in the range of 2\u20133d a y s\n(e.g., Gerbier & Koenig, 2012;T s a i ,1927).\nWe used RIs of 2, 6 and 13 days, a range that\noverlapped and exceeded the RIs used in previ-\nous work using similar procedures.\nOur concern about the RI was prompted by\nresearch on the distributed practice effect with\ntwo learning trials that has shown the relative\neffectiveness of spacing to depend on the dura-\ntion of the RI (e.g., Cepeda et al.,2008; Glenberg,\n1976). A relatively short lag is optimal with a\nshort RI, whereas a long lag is best with an RI\nthat is long relative to the length of the ISI. From\nthe study-phase retrieval perspective (e.g., Benja-\nmin & Tullis, 2010; Toppino & Gerbier, 2014),\nlonger lags between repetitions during learning\nproduce a more durable trace that is forgotten\nmore slowly than traces produced by repetitions\ninvolving shorter lags. However, when an item is\nrepeated after a short lag, the combination of two\nrecent presentations may temporarily result in\nbetter memory than the combination of one\nrecent and one distant presentation. Thus, a short\nlag may lead to better memory than a long lag\nwhen the RI is short, but the more durable trace\nformed from a long lag will win out when the RI\nis long. Applying this analysis to schedule effects\nsuggests that, to the extent that an expanding\nschedule ensures successful study-phase retrieval\nafter the longest (final) lag, it fosters a more\ndurable trace. Thus, the benefit of an expanding\nschedule relative to other schedules may be more\napparent after a long RI. In contrast, a contract-\ning schedule might do relatively well with a short\nRI because the short RI is preceded by two\nrecent presentations.\nModerations in the effect of spacing as a\nfunction of RI also are predicted by Glenberg\u2019s\n(1976, 1979) sophisticated version of encoding\nvariability theory.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4264, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "049ff691-fdfd-4ffb-bb5d-3d8acee9505e": {"__data__": {"id_": "049ff691-fdfd-4ffb-bb5d-3d8acee9505e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "09658211.2014.944916.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/09658211.2014.944916.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 229939, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92a5faab-7564-41ad-8056-e640f7f785b2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "09658211.2014.944916.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/09658211.2014.944916.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 229939, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "09e4b7ad5879acc9e343ce36f63e24c00299983dc9bc5ba6c88a3101501576f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "568e8076-d54a-4a4e-9bb8-a7c5f399ad86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "09658211.2014.944916.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/09658211.2014.944916.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 229939, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "34e4d4cf38a7f7d47ffa4c6ee71cf3424608d4cedf841c1e469733b7dfe3d46d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Thus, a short\nlag may lead to better memory than a long lag\nwhen the RI is short, but the more durable trace\nformed from a long lag will win out when the RI\nis long.

In this case, no difference is\npredicted between the two kinds of schedules.\nIntermediate RIs presumably should produce\nintermediate advantages for contracting sche-\ndules, but it is not obvious that expanding sched-\nule superiority would be expected at any RI.\nAn indication of how schedule differences may\nbe affected by the RI can be found in some of the\nstudies listed in Table 1. K\u00fcpper-Tetzel et al.\n(2014) found that, compared to expanding and\nuniform schedules (which did not differ), con-\ntracting schedules yielded superior performance\nat relatively short RIs and inferior performance at\nlong RIs. Cull (2000, Exps. 2 and 3) reported\nresults suggesting that the rate of forgetting is\nslower for the expanding than for the uniform\nschedule. Kang et al. (2014) also obtained evid-\nence that an expanding schedule results in slower\nforgetting than a uniform schedule based on an\ninteraction between performance at the end of\nthe learning session (numerically favouring uni-\nform) and after 56 days (numerically favouring\nexpanding).\nOverall these results suggest that an expanding\nschedule may slow forgetting, consistent with a\nstudy-phase retrieval interpretation. However, all\nof these studies involved extensive testing and\nstudying during the initial session and often\nduring the review sessions, raising questions\nabout whether the results would generalise to\nour conditions involving only repeated study.

Participants were paid to\ntake part in the study. Three additional partici-\npants did not complete all the sessions, one in\nExp. 1b and two in Exp. 1c. Their results are not\nreported.\nMaterial\nOne hundred pairs consisting of a French word\nand a pseudoword (e.g.,\u201cpomme-sonija\u201d, pomme\nmeaning apple in French) were used. These were\ndivided into 30 target pairs and 70 filler pairs. The\npseudowords had a CVCVCV design and were\nconstructed in a way that made them sufficiently\ndistinct from one another and uniformly unlike\nexisting French words. The words were selected\nfrom the Bonin et al. (2003) database. They had\nhigh lexical frequency and imagery rates, and a\nneutral emotional valence. Target pairs belonged\nto five semantic categories: body parts, animals,\nfruits, house objects and musical instruments,\nwith six exemplars per category. Filler pairs\nbelonged to 13 categories: the same 5 categories\nas above, plus another 4 concrete and 4 abstract\ncategories (with 5 or 6 exemplars per category).\nThe pseudowords and words were combined to\nform pairs in such a way that there was no\nobvious link between the elements of a pair.\nThe target pairs were divided into 3 counterbal-\nancing lists (L1, L2 and L3) of 10 pairs each, with\n2 pairs from each semantic category in each list.\nEach of the 30 target pairs was presented to\nthe participants three times in accordance with\none of the three schedules: uniform, expanding\nand contracting. Schedule was a within-subject\nfactor. For all participants, the 10 pairs from each\nlist (L1, L2 or L3) belonged to different sche-\ndules.

These\nanalyses indicate that distributing repeated study-\ning over a long time span according to an expand-\ning schedule is more advantageous than using\na uniform or contracting schedule and that this\nadvantage is relatively general in the sense that\nit did not differ significantly among the RI\nconditions.\nNevertheless, despite the lack of a reliable\nschedule \u00d7 RI interaction, inspection of the data\nsuggests that the advantage of using an expanding\nschedule was more pronounced for longer RIs.\nBecause this trend was predicted a priori, we\nexamined the data with a series of planned\ncomparisons in which the schedule effect was\nanalysed independently for each RI. One-way,\nrepeated-measures ANOVAs indicated that the\nschedule effect was not reliable with an RI of\n2 days, F(2, 52) < 1.0,MSE = 2.810, approached\nsignificance with an RI of 6 days,F(2, 44) = 2.704,\nMSE = 2.321,p < .08, and was significant with an\nRI of 13 days, F(2, 42) = 4.189, MSE = 1.588,\ng2\np \u00bc 0.17. When the RI was 13 days, performance\nwith the expanding schedule exceeded performance\nwith both the uniform and contracting schedules,\nBonferroni-corrected ts(21) = 2.505 and 2.562,\nrespectively.\nThe question of whether the effect of sche-\ndules is moderated by RI is not independent of\nthe controversy that took place not too long\nago about how the degree of learning affects the\nrate of forgetting. Slamecka and McElree (1983)\nconcluded that forgetting rate was independent of\nthe level of original learning. They reported that\nvariables affecting the level of initial learning did\nnot interact with RI, yielding statistically parallel\nforgetting functions based on the absolute level\nof performance. Loftus (1985) concluded the opp-\nosite, noting that there was a scaling problem.\nAssuming an exponential forgetting function, he\nnoted that, if different levels of initial learning led\nto equal rates of forgetting (i.e., same decay\nparameter), proportional differences in perform-\nance should be maintained across RIs, not abso-\nlute differences in performance.\nAlthough this controversy has never been fully\nresolved (e.g., Wixted, 1990), the issues seem\napplicable in the present context. To the extent\nthat absolute differences in recall are not signifi-\ncantly different across RIs as suggested by our\nnon-significant interaction, Slamecka and McEl-\nree\u2019s( 1983) approach would lead one to conclude\nthat the relative effect of schedule is uninfluenced\nby RI. Loftus\u2019s( 1985) approach would lead to the\nopposite conclusion. An implication of Loftus\u2019s\nview is that, if the forgetting rate were the same in\nall conditions, therelative performance among\nschedules would remain constant across RIs.\nFigure 2.

To test the null hypothesis that the\nsame level of relative performance in each condi-\ntion is obtained for each RI, we conducted\nseparate one-way ANOVAs examining perform-\nance with each schedule as a function of RI.2 The\nresults indicated that relative performance\nbecame greater with increasing RI for the\nexpanding schedule, F(2, 67) = 4.452, MSE =\n2.501, \u03b72 = 0.11, showed no change for the\nuniform schedule, F(2, 67) < 1.00,MSE = 2.267,\nand tended to decline for the contracting sched-\nule, though not quite significantly,F(2, 67) =\n2.309, MSE = 2.780, p < .11, \u03b72 = 0.06. Although\nthese findings are mainly suggestive and should\nbe interpreted with caution, they are consistent\nwith the proposition that an expanding schedule\nleads to a slower rate of forgetting which, in turn,\nwould account for why the advantage of an\nexpanding schedule may become more pro-\nnounced as the RI gets longer.\nIn sum, our results support the prediction\nderived from the study-phase retrieval hypothesis\nthat, within a long time frame, expanding sche-\ndules of distributed practice lead to better per-\nformance than uniform or contracting schedules.\nThe data confirm the trends that are apparent in\nthe data reported by Tsai (1927) and the results\nreported by Gerbier and Koenig (2012, Exp. 1) in\nan online experiment. In contrast, our data do not\nseem to support an interpretation in terms of\nencoding variability theory because it is unclear\nhow this kind of theory can account for superior\nperformance of an expanding schedule over a\ncontracting schedule when both involve identical\ndegrees of spacing.\nOur findings also are consistent with the\nhypothesis that previous failures to obtain this\neffect may be attributable to conditions that\nenhanced study-phase retrieval and reduced the\neffect of varying ISI. These conditions may\ninclude using a short time frame (e.g., Cull,\n2000, Exp. 1), providing extensive original learn-\ning before instituting scheduling variations (e.g.,\nCull,2000, Exps. 3 and 4), and requiring partici-\npants to engage in a recognition task overlaid on\nrepeated study opportunities (Gerbier & Koenig,\n2012, Exp. 2).\nAlthough our results were less conclusive with\nregard to the secondary goal of this research, they\nprovide indications both that the advantage of\nrepeated studying using an expanding schedule\nmay be general across RIs and that this benefit\nmay be more robust when the RI is longer. The\ngenerality of the schedule effect is suggested by\nthe fact that it was not qualified by a significant\ninteraction with RI in the overall ANOVA.\nNevertheless, the possibility that the advantage\nof expanding schedules is more robust with longer\nRIs was consistent with the results of a series of\nFigure 3.

Chicago, for instance, in\n1991, went from 150 truancy officers down to a total of zero. Is that a good idea? In\nthis study, we explore the effects of increased support by a pro-social adult, or \u201csocial\ncapital,\u201d delivered through a structured student monitoring and mentoring program\ncalled Check & Connect (C&C). We carried out a large-scale randomized controlled\ntrial with C&C in partnership with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to students in\ngrades 1 to 8. Program participation decreased absences in grades 5 to 7 by 4.2 days, or\n22.9 percent, but had no detectable effects on students in grades 1 to 4. We also did not\nfind statistically significant effects on learning outcomes such as test scores or GPA,\nor any detectable spillovers to other students within the schools where the program\nwas administered. The modest impacts per dollar spent, compared to previous evidence\non either low-cost \u201cnudges\u201d or relatively intensive, higher-cost interventions, raise the\npossibility that, for very disadvantaged students, there may be decreasing returns that\nare then followed by increasing returns to program intensity for the problem of student\ndisengagement. \u00a9 2020 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\nINTRODUCTION\nA key social-policy priority in the United States is to improve high school gradu-\nation rates for disadvantaged urban youth. Each of the nation\u2019s 10 largest public-\nschool districts has a graduation rate below 80 percent (Common Core of Data,\n2015). In Chicago, the site of our study, the four-year graduation rate is 77 percent\noverall (Common Core of Data, 2015) and about 57 percent for African American\nmales (Healey, Nagaoka, & Michelman, 2014). Whatever increases we have seen in\nhigh school graduation rates over time have not been enough to keep pace with the\nchanging demand in the labor market (Goldin & Katz, 2010; Murnane, 2013). Given\nthe strong relationship between graduation and a range of other outcomes such as\ncrime and health (Cutler & Lleras-Muney, 2010; Meara, Richards, & Cutler, 2008),\ninequality in schooling contributes to inequality in many other domains of American\nlife.\nWhile the decision to drop out of high school has received a great deal of attention,\nthe problems that lead to dropout almost always start much earlier\u2014with chronic\nschool absences, or truancy. In Chicago, the site of this study, almost half of high\nschool students miss at least 10 percent of the school year (over three weeks of\nmissed school), a common threshold for chronic absence (Allensworth & Evans,\nJournal of Policy Analysis and Management, Vol. 00, No. 0, 1\u201342 (2020)\n\u00a9 2020 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\nPublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These problems begin much earlier still: 12.9 percent of elementary stu-\ndents missed over four weeks of school (Jackson, Marx, & Richards, 2012), a group\nthat is at greatly elevated risk of future high school dropout (Cook et al., 2016;\nSchoeneberger, 2011).1 Similar patterns are seen in almost every major urban school\nsystem.\nUnfortunately, very little is currently known about modifiable risk and protec-\ntive factors that contribute to truancy, much less about the most effective possible\nremedies. While school districts have developed a wide range of policies and ad-\nministrative systems to enforce truancy laws since schooling became compulsory in\nthe late 19th century, few if any of these efforts have ever been subject to rigorous\nevaluation. Almost all of this research is observational and may confound the causal\neffects of truancy prevention programs with those of hard-to-measure attributes as-\nsociated with either program implementation decisions (for school- or district-level\nanalyses) or selection into program participation (for student-level analyses).\nPerhaps partly in response to the field\u2019s limited understanding about the value of\ntruancy prevention, such efforts often receive low priority in education policy deci-\nsions. For example, in the 1970s Chicago employed 150 truancy officers to serve the\ncity\u2019s roughly 600 elementary, middle, and high schools (WBEZ, 2014). Responding\nto budget pressures in 1991, in order to save $4 million, the Chicago school board\nreduced the number of truancy officers to \u2026 zero.2 That raises the question: Is this\ntype of de-emphasis on truancy prevention a good idea or a bad idea?\nThe contribution of this paper is to carry out one of the few large-scale random-\nized controlled trials (RCTs) of a promising intervention to reduce truancy. The\nintervention we study here focuses on one important risk/protective factor identi-\nfied by previous observational studies: social capital. Dating back at least to Cole-\nman (1988), social scientists have thought the level of support children have from\nadults is strongly correlated with schooling outcomes. In many of our nation\u2019s most\ndistressed urban areas it is challenging for adults to invest as much time and at-\ntention in children\u2019s outcomes as might be required because poverty, irregular (or\nlong) work schedules, crime, transportation problems, childcare challenges, and un-\ntreated mental or physical health problems make doing so difficult. These problems\nmay be exacerbated when households have just a single adult who must handle all\nof the family\u2019s responsibilities.\nThe specific intervention we test seeks to supplement and support the social cap-\nital that parents can provide by randomly assigning students within the Chicago\nPublic Schools (CPS) to receive Check & Connect (C&C). This program is a school-\nbased, structured mentoring program that is designed to promote student engage-\nment through relationship building, problem solving, and persistence for marginal-\nized students. C&C has four components: (1) a mentor who works with individual\nstudents and their families, (2) regular check-ins by the mentor, (3) timely personal-\nized interventions to reestablish student connection to school and learning, and (4)\nengagement with parents.\nTwo cohorts of students were assigned to the program to determine its impact\non student attendance and achievement. The first cohort consisted of 487 partici-\npating students in 23 randomly selected elementary schools on the south and west\n1 Truancy is also associated with drug and alcohol use, early initiation of sexual activity, teenage preg-\nnancy, and crime (Allensworth & Easton, 2007; Dryfoos, 1990; Hallfors et al., 2002; Huizinga & Jacob-\nChien, 1998; Tait, 2004). For example, data from Illinois state prisons found that of the 182 male youth\nincarcerated in three medium-security youth prisons, 74 percent had previously been labeled chronically\ntruant (Jackson & Marx, 2013).\n2 Similar financial restrictions have led to reduced numbers of truancy officers in Santa Rosa, CA and\nLas Vegas, NV (Los Angeles Times, 2003; Las Vegas Review-Journal, 2009).\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4358, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "293dba30-5643-4e86-8ed2-565119d7fcf6": {"__data__": {"id_": "293dba30-5643-4e86-8ed2-565119d7fcf6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02ae3c1b-8231-4049-b7ce-76d495b6f97b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "92ea90dfef3df819266584125950f2b8aebf2e642bfc398b26b4e6d5ad5b7f2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes/ 3\nsides of Chicago, who received C&C services during academic year (AY) 2011/2012\nand 2012/2013 (including summers). The second cohort included 348 students in\nnine of the original 23 schools who received C&C services during AY 2013/2014 and\n2014/2015 (including summers); 70 of the participating students in the second co-\nhort were randomly selected from among the participating students from the first\ncohort. In general, students were eligible to receive C&C services if they had be-\ntween 10 and 35 absences the previous school year. (More details are below). To de-\ntect spillover effects on nonparticipating students, we randomized at three different\nlevels: the school, the grade, and the student. We used student-level, longitudinal ad-\nministrative data collected by CPS to measure the program\u2019s impact on attendance,\ngrades, and standardized test scores.\nOur findings suggest that C&C generated statistically significant reductions in\nabsences for middle school-aged students, but not for elementary school-aged stu-\ndents. Based on estimates of the effects of treatment on the treated (TOT), we find\nthat participation in C&C decreased student absences among students who began\nthe program in grades 5 to 7 by a statistically significant 4.2 days, or 22.9 percent\nrelative to the control complier mean. We do not find statistically significant effects\nof participating in C&C among students who began the program in grades 1 to 4.\nAcross the two cohorts, the effect of participating in C&C was about 50 percent larger\nin the second year of the intervention than the first. While this difference was not\nstatistically significant, it suggests that the development of relationships between\nthe mentor and student could be an important mechanism through which the men-\ntoring program is effective. We did not find statistically significant effects of C&C\non academic learning outcomes such as achievement test scores or grade point av-\nerage, although the size of our 95 percent confidence intervals does not allow us to\nrule out modest impacts on these outcomes.\nWhile C&C was effective in that it improved key outcomes for a target popula-\ntion of students, it is useful to compare C&C to other interventions that have an\nimpact on student engagement outcomes, as interventions vary in cost, complexity\nof implementation, and the mechanisms through which they affect change in stu-\ndent behavior and outcomes. As implemented in this project, the C&C program cost\nabout $1700 per student per year. This translates to a cost of approximately $400\nper incremental day of attendance brought about by the intervention for the 5th- to\n7th-grade students.\nBy way of comparison, other recent interventions attempted to improve atten-\ndance by leveraging insights from behavioral science to \u201cnudge\u201d people through\ninformation provision. This sort of intervention has the benefit of being automa-\ntized, low-cost, and scalable. For example, Rogers and Feller (2018) and Robinson\net al. (2018) find that a mail-based intervention providing parents of frequently-\nabsent students with information about their students\u2019 attendance record decreases\nabsences by about one day, at a cost of $6 to $11 per additional attendance-day. It is\nclear this type of intervention operates through a different set of mechanisms than a\nmore comprehensive and costly person-centered intervention like C&C, which sug-\ngests that a broader set of outcomes besides attendance may be required for evaluat-\ning relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Other intensive interventions with\ncosts similar to C&C have been shown to be effective at improving student engage-\nment, even when school attendance was not the primary focus of the intervention\n(Heller et al., 2017) and to simultaneously produce large gains in other outcomes\nsuch as school engagement, high school graduation, and delinquency.\nIt ultimately may turn out that for very economically disadvantaged student pop-\nulations, such as those in our Chicago study, there may be decreasing but then in-\ncreasing returns to program intensity to address the problems of attendance and\nschool disengagement. That is, the impacts per dollar spent may be nonlinear: po-\ntentially highest from the least-intensiveand most-intensive programs compared to\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4496, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b10025a-5b2b-4a3a-945a-4e9f37fff5a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b10025a-5b2b-4a3a-945a-4e9f37fff5a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0632a0b-8de3-4c29-b2a6-96f2c7c109d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "6c2592ed243970c959037b0c398fad4ac1167765c2290e111aecb563064a6e8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "4 / The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes\nthose of \u201cmedium\u201d intensity.

Balfanz and Byrnes (2012)\ncategorize absent students by their agency and decisions to attend school, distin-\nguishing between those who cannot attend (due to illness or housing instability),\nthose who refuse to attend (to avoid bullying or unsafe conditions), and those who\nchoose not to attend (because they are uninterested in school). The risk and protec-\ntive factors that contribute to students falling into different categories can be school-\nbased or within the family or community (see, for example, Chang & Romero, 2008).\nSurely, these different factors often interact in their effects. For example, a child\nwith a sick younger sibling may stay home to provide care if the parent is unable to\nget off work to provide care. Many affluent parents who have the advantage of work-\ning in more accommodating jobs or being able to afford to pay childcare, would be\nable to send the child to school in the same case of sibling illness. Should we attribute\nthe absence then to illness, or workplace problems, or unaffordable childcare, or\nsomething else?\nRecognizing these complexities, much of the research that has been done around\nstudent absenteeism argues that illness or health issues are the primary barrier to\nschool attendance (Ehrlich et al., 2014; Kearney, 2008). This conclusion is often\ndrawn from information collected through school administrative data, which may\nnot be designed to detect more nuanced factors driving student absenteeism, espe-\ncially those that occur outside of the school setting. However, further analyses reveal\nthe significant role out-of-school economic and family circumstances may play in\nabsenteeism. For example, one national survey found that children in single-mother\nfamilies are twice as likely as children in two-parent families to report missing at\nleast 11 days of school the previous school year for health-related reasons (Bloom,\nJones, & Freeman, 2013) and an analysis of administrative data from six states found\nstudents living in poverty are also more likely to be chronically absent (Balfanz &\nByrnes, 2012).\nSimilarly, absences that stem from school refusal behavior are hard to quantify, as\nsuch behavior may be indicated by tardiness or incomplete absences, the definitions\nof which vary by district (Kearney, 2008). One study found that truancy rates jump\nfor students who are transitioning school levels (elementary school to middle school\nand middle school to high school), which may indicate absences that are driven\nby student reluctance or anxiety about adjusting to a new environment, peers, and\nschedule (Garrison, 2006).\nStudents attending urban schools are also more likely to miss school. In a na-\ntional survey of 8th-grade students, those attending urban or city schools were more\nlikely to report being absent three or more times in the past month than 8th-grade\n3 A similar program of research seeks to understand the effectiveness of different levels of intensity for in-\nterventions for promoting college attendance and persistence for low-income students; see, for example,\nBettinger and Evans (2019), Hyman (2019), and Oreopoulos and Ford (2019).\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4145, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f025bbc-b095-4449-addc-518c1c13a701": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f025bbc-b095-4449-addc-518c1c13a701", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8871b11a-4530-4196-873a-6eceadeba42e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "68fa3a56cc0fa2557b7a9ab871c418fee68dce56529eece9fa528231ae53752a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes/ 5\nstudents attending rural or suburban schools (Child Trends Databank, 2015). One\nstudy found that schools in high-poverty urban areas have up to one-third of their\nstudents chronically absent (Balfanz & Byrnes, 2012).\nHigh levels of truancy clustered around certain grades reflect a pattern of absences\nthat seem to evolve with the age of the student. A meta-analysis of administrative\ndata from Oregon, Nebraska, Florida, and West Virginia found that chronic absen-\nteeism goes down in third and fourth grades before sharply increasing in middle\nschool, especially for students in sixth to eighth grades (Balfanz & Byrnes, 2012).\nThis pattern makes clear that rather than being a static condition, absenteeism is\noften caused by multiple and shifting barriers to attendance.\nInterventions to address student absenteeism often target one or only a few spe-\ncific barriers to attendance. Clinical or medically-based interventions are sometimes\ndeployed to target youth with anxiety-based problems through pharmacotherapy or\ncognitive-behavioral strategies. Some work to influence the out-of-school environ-\nment of the student\u2014by providing earlier family-school engagement or after-school\nprograms. Others focus on providing additional professional development to teach-\ners working with at-risk youth (Kearney, 2008).4\nSome of these programs yield encouraging results in previous (mostly observa-\ntional) studies: A review of absenteeism-prevention programs found that alterna-\ntive education programs and behavioral programs may have positive impacts on at-\ntendance, academic performance, and graduation (Klima, Miller, & Nunlist, 2009).\nConditional cash transfers to incentivize school attendance in Colombia have been\nshown to be effective in improving student outcomes (Angrist et al., 2002; Angrist,\nBettinger, & Kremer, 2006; Barrera-Osorio et al., 2008). However, providing financial\nincentives for improved attendance seems to be less common in the United States\nthan outside of it. The results of the Opportunity NYC conditional cash transfer\nprogram, including the limited impacts on children\u2019s attendance and other school-\ning outcomes, may have contributed to dampened enthusiasm for this approach in\nthe U.S. (Riccio et al., 2013).\nOne potential limitation of many strategies is that they fail to support the personal\nrelationships that are often vital for success within a socialized system, referred to\ninitially by Coleman (1988) as \u201csocial capital.\u201d Social capital exists in the relations\nbetween actors and, much in the same way that physical and financial capital do,\nfacilitates productive activity. Coleman (1988) divides social capital into three forms:\nobligations and expectations, information channels, and social norms. Each of these\nforms provides a structure that promotes action and may be targeted to support\na specific behavior, like attending school. It is possible that mentoring programs\ndesigned to engage at-risk students may form and utilize social capital in a way that\nhelps a student to change their behavior. Mentoring programs may develop trusted\nrelationships that create perceived obligations by the student. Mentors may also\nprovide information and influence social norms.\nThere is some evidence of the effectiveness of mentoring programs. Random-\nized controlled trials of Big Brothers Big Sisters, a national community-based and\nschool-based mentoring program, have found significant impacts on improving\nacademic achievement (Bayer, Grossman, & DuBois, 2015; Grossman et al., 2012;\nHerrera et al., 2007; Schwartz, et al., 2011) and decreasing unexcused absences\n(Grossman et al., 2012; Herrera et al., 2007; Schwartz et al., 2011).

The program, called\nPathways to Education, included \u201cmentoring, daily tutoring, and group activities, combined with inter-\nmediate and long-term incentives to reinforce a minimum degree of mandatory participation\u201d and found\npositive effects on high school graduation and postsecondary enrollment rates.\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4382, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "410d6876-7fe8-4693-85f8-79c78a12d5f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "410d6876-7fe8-4693-85f8-79c78a12d5f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "76705e38-3a61-4b3c-901b-05adc9caddfb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "8f9ff582bdf89ee99a4ad339c1fff23ca1f2b6b38e8c1f7813d469f9c895a19d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "6 / The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes\nprograms have also been found to improve socioemotional outcomes, including self-\nreported measures of depression (Herrera, DuBois, & Grossman, 2013), peer con-\nnectedness and self-esteem (Karcher, 2008), and pro-social behavior (Schwartz et al.,\n2011). One challenge with these studies is that they typically rely on self-reported\noutcomes. This may confound the effect of the intervention on actual behavior and\noutcomes with the possibility that youth assigned to mentors may be less willing to\nreport socially undesirable outcomes for fear of disappointing their mentor (known\nin the survey research literature as \u201csocial desirability bias\u201d).\nTHE CHECK & CONNECT (C&C) PROGRAM\nIn response to Chicago Public School concerns about truancy, and the decision sev-\neral decades earlier to phase out all truancy officers for budget reasons, we visited\nthe U.S. Department of Education\u2019s What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) for what\nthe available evidence suggests is best practice for improving school attendance.\nWWC suggested one intervention that seemed particularly promising: Check & Con-\nnect, developed at the University of Minnesota by Sandra Christenson and other\ncolleagues from the University of Minnesota, as well as various school personnel.\nC&C is a structured mentoring program that aims to reduce the number of days\nthat students miss school and to increase students\u2019 engagement with academic activ-\nities when they are in school. C&C has been implemented in several school districts\naround the United States, beginning in the Minneapolis Public Schools. C&C typi-\ncally targets students who are at risk of disengagement or dropping out of school\u2014\noften measured by high rates of absenteeism or poor academic performance\u2014and\nassigns them to a mentor, who is typically an in-school staff member. Mentors are\nasked to monitor the attendance and school performance of the students on their\ncaseload; serve as case managers, connecting students to social services and school-\nbased resources that the mentors think might help the student to overcome barriers\nto school attendance; and develop relationships with the students on their caseload.\nC&C isstandardized in the sense that there is a manual and a set of training ma-\nterials that can be used to implement the program, but it is alsoadaptive in the\nsense that mentors are encouraged to assess why different students are not coming\nto school and tailor the ways they intervene with students to match what they think\nstudents need.\nThe C&C manual and training directs mentors to support student engage-\nment through two primary channels (Christenson, Storm, & Pohl, 2012). The\n\u201cCheck\u201d component centers on monitoring student performance\u2014tracking atten-\ndance, grades, and behavior referrals\u2014for signs of disengagement. Mentors then\ndeliver personalized interventions to students designed to boost engagement as part\nof the \u201cConnect\u201d piece. These interventions are supposed to be based on informa-\ntion the mentor has about the student\u2019s school engagement level and family circum-\nstances and to be shaped around available school and community resources. Men-\ntors are also encouraged to connect with families of students, to partner with par-\nents to increase student engagement, and to function as liaisons between home and\nschool. In this study, mentors formally met with students, one-on-one or in small\ngroups, an average of five times a month. Mentors also had informal check-ins with\nstudents through encounters that took place at recess, in the lunchroom, and hall-\nway, among other school environments. On average, they connected with guardians\nthrough home visits or by phone twice a month, although the level of family engage-\nment varied substantially by mentor.\nWhile there have been several previous randomized controlled trials of C&C, the\nmost encouraging results to date have been limited to studies focusing on students\nreceiving special education services (Sinclair, Christenson & Thurlow, 2005; Sinclair\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4192, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a17d546-49f2-4f50-b972-f2b60959091f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a17d546-49f2-4f50-b972-f2b60959091f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "491e41e7-354e-4626-9b72-32e4faed258a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "6eda25c48cf24e9b6ba548d33fd6c099840ccc5635b1904e5d33d8e42313fe4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes/ 7\net al., 1998).5 The two RCTs that have been carried out with more general samples\nof high school students to date have yielded more mixed results. For example, May-\nnard, Kjellstrand, and Thompson (2014) find some evidence for impacts on grades\nand disciplinary referrals, but no detectable impacts on the key outcome C&C was\ndesigned to change: absences. Heppen et al. (2017) found no detectable effects on\nany of the key student outcomes they examine, including educational attainment,\nacademic performance, or various types of engagement such as attendance. How-\never, this could be due to limitations of the studies themselves, which include small\nsamples (just N= 134 treatment-group students in Maynard et al. and N= 276\ntreatment students in Heppen et al.) and, in the case of Maynard et al., high rates\nof sample attrition (27 percent) that differed for treatment vs. control. In the case\nof Heppen et al., a high percentage of students was so credit deficient prior to C&C\nintervention from 9th grade performance that it was not possible for them to grad-\nuate on time. These results may indicate that C&C is more suitable for elementary\nor middle school youth than for older students.6\nThe current study builds on this existing work by focusing on students earlier in\ntheir schooling careers (elementary and middle school), where beneficial impacts\nmay be more likely, and on general samples of students who have exhibited previous\nabsenteeism, not just restricted to those eligible for special education services. We\nalso examine two full cohorts of program participants to try to improve statistical\npower through larger sample sizes relative to some previous research. Specifically,\nC&C was implemented in the CPS by a social service agency called SGA Youth and\nFamily Services (SGA). Mentors were selected and hired by SGA to work as full-\ntime C&C mentors. SGA initially hired 15 mentors to work in 23 CPS schools, and\nwhen mentors quit or were fired, SGA hired replacements. SGA also employed a\nfull-time project manager who served as the supervisor of the C&C mentors. The\nSGA project manager oversaw the work of the mentors, organized and led weekly\nmeetings of the mentors, and provided guidance and feedback to mentors about how\nto work most effectively with the students. In addition, a project manager within CPS\noversaw the implementation of the C&C program, oversaw the SGA project manager,\nand helped to collect data on participation and implementation. Once or twice each\nyear, consultants from the research team at the University of Minnesota conducted\ntraining sessions with the C&C mentors to provide professional development and\nguidance on how to implement the C&C program with fidelity.\nBased on this previous work and conversations with CPS about the context and\ncharacteristics of the students to be targeted for intervention, the current study pro-\nvided intervention for two years. Two cohorts of students received C&C services for\ntwo years each, and a small subset of students received the program for all four\nyears.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nIn order to identify the causal effects of C&C on not just participating students but\nalso others within the school, our research design involved random assignment of\n5 C&C has also been implemented in a number of places outside of Minneapolis, but not structured\nto be studied like RCTs. For example, Tulsa and San Diego used C&C to support students at risk of\ndiscontinuing school or to serve youth with disabilities; Florida, Missouri, and Utah have developed state-\nwide initiatives that implement C&C in schools that have a high rate of students at risk of disengagement.\nThe program has also been delivered to juvenile offenders and post-secondary students, although these\ncontexts have been less common.\n6 In addition, C&C\u2019s effect on elementary school students has been evaluated in the past (Anderson et al.,\n2004; Lehr, Sinclair, & Christenson, 2004), but these studies were not experimental and have relied on\ncomparing student outcomes to baseline measures, rather than to a randomized control group.\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4297, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68422f4d-7555-48eb-8749-ae45ad5b6c96": {"__data__": {"id_": "68422f4d-7555-48eb-8749-ae45ad5b6c96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d5594e6-53ce-4a6d-afc0-b3b817f7a272", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "fe21870c486eaaef2fa1d85b6a92747c09d7f6c1cfae630ed4db4b54df818ce2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "8 / The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes\n69 participating K-8\nCPS schools\nSchool triple\n2 control (C) \nschools\n1 treatment \n(T) school\nGrades 1-7\n2 C grades 5 T grades\nStudent triple\n2 C students 1 T student\nT students offered \ntreatment in descending \norder of baseline absences \nuntil target C&C caseload \nin school met\nStudent triple ...\nSchool triple School triple ...\nFigure 1.

First, in collaboration with CPS, we went through a process of\nchoosing 69 schools serving grades K-8 to be a part of the study.7 We tried to choose\nschools that were broadly representative of the district in terms of the demographic\nand socioeconomic characteristics of the students, and we wanted to ensure that\nthe schools had a large enough group of students in each grade with absences in\nthe range of 10 to 35 days in the prior year. We also took geographic location into\nconsideration because, in cohort 1, the C&C mentors were to be initially assigned\nto two schools each.

The 69 selected schools are mostly on the south and west sides of Chicago, in\nneighborhoods that range from some of the very poorest in the city and the coun-\ntry, to some with moderate poverty levels by a Chicago benchmark (but still quite\nhigh-poverty within the national distribution). The free or reduced-price lunch rates\nranged from 71.2 to 99.8 percent in 2010/2011 for the schools that were selected for\nthe cohort 1 study.\nWe placed those 69 schools into groups of three, matching on geographic location,\nstudent race and ethnic demographics, and school-level absence rates, and randomly\nselected one school from within each group of three to be the location for treatment\nin the cohort 1 study. We conducted this first round of school-level random selec-\ntion to allow for estimates of spillover effects on control students within the schools\nwhere C&C was implemented.\nThen, within each of the 23 cohort 1 study schools, we randomly selected five\ngrades between the first and seventh to offer the program.8 The remaining two\ngrades were in the control group and were intended to help identify spillover ef-\nfects under the assumption that spillover effects might be more pronounced within\ngrades than across grades.\nAmong the five selected grades, we then placed students into groups of three,\nmatched based on baseline absences, and randomly selected one of the three stu-\ndents to be offered treatment. Students who had 10 to 35 absences in the prior year\nwere eligible to be selected for the offer to participate in the C&C program.9\nThe students selected for treatment were sorted within school and grade in de-\nscending order based on baseline absences and were approached and offered the\nchance to participate in C&C in that order. In our analysis, we always include all stu-\ndents randomly selected for treatment regardless of whether they were approached\nand offered the chance to participate. Thus, the ordering of students for the offer of\ntreatment does not bias our results. The ordering did induce students with higher\nbaseline absence rates to be more likely to be compliers, which means that if there\nare heterogeneous treatment effects, the estimated effects of participating are for\nstudents with baseline absence rates somewhat towards the higher end of the 10\nto 35 range. We include all students, not just those offered treatment, because we\nre-randomized some cohort 1 treatment group students into treatment and control\ngroups in cohort 2 in a way that was not conditional on having been offered treat-\nment in cohort 1. Though restricting the analysis to randomization blocks that in-\nclude students who were offered treatment could generate an unbiased estimate of\nthe treatment effect in cohort 1, it is necessary to include all randomized students\nfrom cohort 1 in the analysis to maintain the validity of randomization for cohort 2.\n8 In CPS, the K-8 schools are called elementary schools even though they include students in grades that\nwould commonly be in middle schools or junior high schools. Most elementary schools in CPS include\ngrades K to 8, and most high schools include grades 9 to 12. There are very few middle schools in CPS.\nWe chose not to offer the program to students who would be in 8th grade in the first year of the study\nbecause the program was planned to last for two school years, and we thought it would be logistically\ndifficult for mentors to follow students from their elementary school to a high school.\n9 Because the sizes of the randomization blocks were not all multiples of three, some of the \u201ctriples\u201d\nhad two, four, or five students in them. In the main analyses reported below, we ignore the grouping\nof students into triples because, aside from the existence of the handful that had two, four, or five in\nthem, within each student triplet the probability of being selected for treatment was constant at 1/3. If\neach block of students had exactly three students, the triple fixed effects would therefore be uncorrelated\nwith treatment assignment and omitting them would not cause bias. In practice, while this is not literally\nthe case, because there are few blocks that do not have exactly three students, excluding the triple fixed\neffects does not change the point estimates appreciably.

Nine of the 15 mentors\nwere invited to continue. Of the original 23 schools in the cohort 1 study, several\nwere closed as a part of school closings that occurred at the end of the 2012/2013\nschool year. The nine schools where the nine returning mentors primarily worked\nwere selected to continue the program for cohort 2.\nWithin the cohort 2 study schools, we placed students into five randomization\nblocks. Three of the randomization blocks were for students who had been in the\ncohort 1 study, one block for students who had been assigned to treatment in cohort\n1, one for students who had been assigned to control in cohort 1 who had baseline\nabsences between 10 and 35, and one for students who had been assigned to control\nin cohort 1 who had baseline absences outside the 10 to 35 range. This will allow us\nto experimentally test whether getting four years of participation generates larger\neffects than two years of participation. The program was offered to students who\nwere in grades 1 to 7 in the first year of cohort 1; students in both the cohort 1 and\ncohort 2 studies were therefore in grades 1 to 5 in the first year of cohort 1, and in\ngrades 3 to 7 in the first year of cohort 2. To fill in the two earlier grades for cohort\n2, so that we would also have data on 1st- and 2nd-grade students in cohort 2 (and\ntherefore cover a similar range of grades as in cohort 1), we created a randomization\nblock of students who were in first and second grades in the first year of cohort 2.\nWe also created a block of students who were new to the cohort 2 schools since the\nrandomization for cohort 1. Since the probability of selection into treatment was\nnot equal across all randomization blocks in cohort 2, we include randomization\nblock fixed effects in all cohort 2 models. Finally, we offered principals at the schools\nthe opportunity to nominate students to be in the study. Students nominated by\nprincipals were placed in their own randomization block within each school and\nsubject to random assignment.10\nDATA, DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, AND TESTS OF BASELINE BALANCE\nIn this section, we describe the student-level school records we use to measure base-\nline characteristics and outcomes, document the level of disadvantage among the\nstudents in our study sample, and confirm that random assignment appears to have\nbeen carried out correctly.\nData\nThe data for this study are drawn from longitudinal student-level records from the\nChicago Public Schools (CPS) for AY 2010/2011 through 2014/2015, and program\nparticipation data collected by C&C mentors and a CPS project manager. The CPS\ndata include demographics, attendance, enrollment, misconduct, and achievement\noutcomes. The demographic data include each student\u2019s birth date, race/ethnicity,\neligibility for free and reduced-price lunch, and an indicator for having a learning\ndisability (indicated by having an Individualized Education Plan, or IEP).\nBecause a critical focus of C&C is to reduce student absences, measures of atten-\ndance and absences are the primary outcome variables in the analyses. The data\ninclude measures of attendance and absences: days present, meaning the number\n10 In a few cases, principals submitted lists of nominated students after randomization had already taken\nplace for their school. In these cases, we followed the initial random assignment for nominated students\nwho were already subject to random assignment in one of the other randomization blocks, and then\ncreated a randomization block consisting of the nominated students who were not in one of the other\nrandomization blocks.\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3860, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3c1cbb6-db98-4b5a-8318-3eb467623a08": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3c1cbb6-db98-4b5a-8318-3eb467623a08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6f7433d-94b6-4c9b-ae30-9916f139f545", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "4b0ef504b9ebb5e68c3395b3403affe55339fce19e2ae960a0c0a9cbe75af71b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "12 / The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes\nof enrolled days a student attended school over the school year; days absent, mean-\ning the number of enrolled days a student was absent over the school year; percent\npresent, meaning the percentage of enrolled days a student was present over the\nschool year; and membership days, meaning the total number of days the student\nwas officially enrolled in a CPS school. Membership days are the sum of days present\nand days absent, but do not necessarily equal the total number of school days in the\nCPS school year. Students can move in the middle of the school year and leave CPS,\nand it is also possible that students might not accumulate membership days for a\nshort period when they transfer from one school to another within CPS.\nOur analyses of achievement outcomes use annual grade point average (GPA) and\nmath and reading test scores. The test score data come from two different sources\nbecause CPS administered multiple tests for elementary school students over the\nstudy period.11\nThe C&C program manager at CPS maintained records of which students were ap-\nproached and offered the chance to participate in C&C and which of those students\nparticipated in the program. We use this information to measure the C&C partici-\npation rates used to estimate the effects of participation (treatment on the treated)\ndescribed below. Finally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with students and\ntheir parents to understand the explicit and implicit reasons for student absences.\nWe attempted to contact a random sample of 76 students and a parent or guardian\nfrom the full C&C intervention group and interviewed 51 of the 76 student/parent\npairs.\nDescriptive Statistics and Balance Tests\nTables 1 and 2 present baseline descriptive statistics and randomization balance\ntests for the students in the C&C schools. We focus for now (and in our initial impact\nanalysis) on just those grades selected to receive C&C, so that the control group\nconsists of students in treatment grades who were randomly assigned to the control\ncondition.\nTable 1 shows that for cohort 1, in the year before random assignment (2010/2011),\ncontrol and treatment students attended on average 150.2 and 151.0 out of a possible\n170 days of school.12 Nearly 60 percent of students in the study sample were African-\nAmerican and just under 40 percent were Hispanic. On average, students failed 0.70\nand 0.68 courses in control and treatment, respectively, in the year prior to the study,\n11 The first test for which we have reading and math test score data is the Illinois Standards Achievement\nTest (ISAT), which was state-mandated during the 2011/2012, 2012/2013, and 2013/2014 school years.\nThe ISAT was administered in math and reading among third through eighth graders annually in the\nspring during each of these school years, but was discontinued after the 2013/2014 school year. The ISAT\nmeasures individual student achievement relative to the Common Core State Standards. During the first\nthree academic years of the study, ISAT scores were used to determine Adequate Yearly Progress for\nschools as part of the district and state school accountability systems. The second standardized test we\nanalyze is the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP), published by the Northwest Evaluation Association\n(NWEA). The MAP was administered in each of the four years of the study in math and reading to students\nin grades 3 through 8, and additionally to students in grade 2 in the final two years of the study. The MAP\nassessment is a computerized, adaptive test that changes which questions to ask students based on an\nestimate of ability level as indicated by responses to previous questions. For all four study years MAP\nscores were used as part of the growth component of teachers\u2019 evaluations and for the 2014/2015 school\nyear, the MAP scores replaced ISAT scores in the state school accountability system.\n12 As a reminder, total days present and total days absent do not sum to the length of the school year\nbecause some students were not enrolled as a CPS student for the entire school year, possibly because\nthey moved out of the district. For this reason, in the analyses below, we report effects on days present\nand days absent separately and analyze the treatment effect on the sum of days present and days absent,\nw h i c hi sc a l l e dm e m b e r s h i pd a y s .\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4558, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e70d4fc-d16a-4601-bf1f-173c34b329b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e70d4fc-d16a-4601-bf1f-173c34b329b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad8110e8-52c0-48fc-afb9-3907dc1fb89d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "34fcd1124d9d5f68db060c0089225c8f25850731376da603609b9e9db9c25683", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes/ 13\nTable 1.Cohort 1 student baseline characteristics.\nBaseline Characteristics Control Treatment\nStudents (n) 1,846 933\nDays Present in 2010/11 SY 150.18 150.95\nDays Absent in 2010/11 SY 16.13 16.28\nPercent Male 0.53 0.53\nAge 8.74 8.72\nPercent Old for Grade 0.16 0.15\nPercent Black 0.57 0.57\nPercent Hispanic 0.39 0.4\nPercent Learning Disability 0.11 0.1\nNumber of Course Failures in 2010/11 SY 0.7 0.68\nGPA in 2010/11 SY 2.21 2.24\nP-value on F-test\nWithout missing data indicators p = .775\nWith missing data indicators p = .84\nNotes: The length of the CPS school year changed during the study.

In cohort 2, when we randomly ordered the\ntriples to approach for the program, none of the baseline variables were significantly\nrelated to participation.\nANALYSIS PLAN\nEstimating Program Impacts\nOur goal is to estimate the causal effect of participating in the C&C program on\nstudent attendance and academic outcomes. We rely on the random assignment of\nthe offer to participate in the program to identify the causal effect. We present two\ntypes of estimates: intent to treat (ITT) and treatment on the treated (TOT). The ITT\nestimate comes from estimating equation (1):\nYit = \u03c00 + \u03c01Z1i + \u03c02X0i + \u03c03Bi + \u03b5it, (1)\nwhere Yit is an outcome for studenti measured after random assignment in year\nt \u2208 (1, 2) of the program; Z1i is an indicator for student-level random assignment\nto treatment, or in other words, an indicator for the student having been randomly\nassigned to the treatment condition within a treatment grade;Bi is a set of school\neffects for cohort 1 and a set of school and randomization block fixed effects for\ncohort 2; \u03b5itis a random error term; andX0iis a set of baseline controls measured\nprior to random assignment that includes days present, days absent, GPA, course\nfailures, indicators for gender, race/ethnicity, age, old for grade, and presence of\na learning disability. Our estimate of\u03c01 corresponds to the standard estimate for\nthe effect of offering students the intervention, or the \u201cintent to treat\u201d (ITT), which\ncomes from comparing treatment and control students within the treatment grades\nat the same school.\nSince the offer to participate was not extended to all students who were randomly\nassigned to treatment, and because some students offered the chance to participate\ndeclined, the ITT is likely to understate the magnitude of the effect of participating\nin C&C. To estimate the effect of having a C&C mentor, we use random assignment\nas an instrument for participation (Angrist, Imbens, & Rubin, 1996; Bloom, 1984).\nThis recovers the effect of the treatment on the treated (TOT) because no students\nassigned to the control group were assigned to a C&C mentor. We estimate the TOT\nby applying two-stage least squares to equations (2) and (3):\nDit = \u03c10 + \u03c1 Z1i + \u03c1X0i + \u03c1 Bi + \u03bait (2)\nYit = \u03b20 + \u03b2 Dit + \u03b2 X0i + \u03b2 Bi + \u03c5it. (3)\nBy using random assignment to be offered the treatment condition (Z1i)a sa n\ninstrument for participation (Dit), the TOT estimate is identified by conditional ran-\ndom assignment. The TOT does not compare participants to nonparticipants\u2014that\ncomparison would be biased because participants are different on average than non-\nparticipants. Rather, the TOT compares students randomly assigned to treatment,\nregardless of whether they were invited to participate and regardless of whether they\nchose to participate, to control students (the ITT), and scales this comparison by the\nparticipation rate among the treatment group to recover the effect of receiving treat-\nment on those who participated.\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3449, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46b15d7a-7582-4f5d-bae9-675e127bc4e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "46b15d7a-7582-4f5d-bae9-675e127bc4e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c05cac0a-0759-449d-bf78-e442e7d8a599", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "ceb68c04efee61eed2001e5c93f2c9b36f494f346b5b39c4f380ac72d49cb75e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes/ 17\nWe examine the possibility of within grade and treatment school spillover for co-\nhort 1 in the next section. The treatment grade and school spillover estimates come\nfrom equation (4), excluding treatment assigned students:\nYit = \u03b30 + \u03b32 Z2i + \u03b33 Z3i + \u03b33 X0i + \u03b34 Bi + \u03b6it, (4)\nwhere the numeric subscripts on the Zs correspond to the three levels of ran-\ndom assignment (student, grade, and school) so that Z2i and Z3i are, respec-\ntively, indicators for being in a grade and school that was randomly assigned for\ntreatment.\nOur estimate for\u03b32 in equation (4) represents the difference in average outcomes\nbetween control students in treatment versus control grades, and so captures any\n\u201cspillover\u201d effects of the C&C intervention on other students within the grade. For\nexample, if C&C mentors help to reduce absences among chronically absent stu-\ndents, those students might be less likely to induce their friends to skip school. Or,\nas noted above, the C&C mentor might wind up inadvertently working with control\ngroup students if they accompany treatment-group friends to their mentor visits.Bi\nis a set of school randomization block fixed effects.\nOur estimate for\u03b32 also tells us how \u201coff\u201d the standard ITT estimate is in the case\nof spillovers, in the sense that if we used random assignment of grades within treat-\nment schools to treatment versus control, we could generate an unbiased estimate\nfor the effects of offering students C&C by comparing treatment students in treat-\nment grades to control students in control grades, which is\u03c01 + \u03b32. The first term\nin this case can be thought of as the bias that results from using control students\nwithin treatment grades as a comparison group in the standard ITT estimator. Of\ncourse, it is also logically possible that there could be spillovers of the C&C men-\ntor across grades, not just within grades. We can examine that possibility in our\ndata by comparing control students in control grades in treatment schools to stu-\ndents in control schools (\u03b33), since the 23 cohort 1 schools were randomly selected\nfrom a group of 69 schools. We return to this in our discussion of the empirical re-\nsults below. We limit our spillover analysis to cohort 1 because some of the cohort\n1 treatment schools were closed at the end of cohort 1, and cohort 2 randomization\noccurred within a nonrandom subset of cohort 1 treatment schools. It was there-\nfore impossible to construct comparable control-school comparison samples for\ncohort 2.\nGiven our randomized experimental design, perhaps the main threats to valid in-\nference with our study come from sample attrition and from the fact that we examine\na number of different outcomes\u2014that is, multiple testing concerns. We discuss our\ntests for sample attrition below. To address multiple hypothesis testing, we present\nfamily-wise error rates (FWER) in our main results tables using the bootstrapping\nprocedure described in Heller et al., 2017. For a given family of outcomes (defined\nin detail immediately below), we randomly permute the treatment assignment vari-\nables Z1i within randomization \u201cblocks,\u201d reestimate the ITT effect in the permuted\ndata, record the distribution of p-values that results, and re-permute the data and\nrepeat this procedure 100,000 times. We then calculate our FWER-adjusted p-values\nby examining where, for instance, the most significant p-value in our data (with the\ntrue treatment assignment variable values) falls within the distribution of p-values\nfor the most significant \u201ceffect\u201d within the family of outcomes in our permuted data.\nThis accounts for the correlation across outcomes in our data, and of outcomes\nacross students within schools and grades.\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3903, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12fa3d5a-8f45-42e7-ab23-7f76b5dfe235": {"__data__": {"id_": "12fa3d5a-8f45-42e7-ab23-7f76b5dfe235", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1580df8f-1d57-4fdb-adb8-777db2b26c3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "c06b12510dcf9306413b3e8da71b4ff5889cdabcd5245216f402165c79803a2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "18 / The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes\nRESULTS\nOverall Effects on School Attendance\nTable 5 presents our main results for our days absent outcome. Since most of our\ntables have the same structure, we take a moment to describe this structure in some\ndetail. Each \u201ccell\u201d or panel within the table presents the results of a separate regres-\nsion. Each row in the table presents results separately by cohort, with results from\ncohort 1 in the first row, cohort 2 in the second row, and a sample that pools cohort\n1 and 2 together (for improved statistical power) in the third row. The first column\npresents the results using data just from students who were in grades 1 to 4, the\nsecond column presents the results for students in grades 5 to 7, and the third col-\numn presents the results from all students in grades 1 to 7 pooled together. For each\nseparate regression, we present the control group mean, the ITT effect and its stan-\ndard error, the TOT effect and its standard error, and the average outcome for those\ncontrols who would have participated in C&C had they been offered treatment (the\n\u201ccontrol complier mean,\u201d or CCM, from Katz, Kling, & Liebman, 2001). Underneath\neach ITT estimate, we present the FWER-adjusted p-value, defining our \u201cfamily\u201d of\ntests as each hypothesis test that shows up in Table 5 (or 16 in total).\nBefore turning to the estimated treatment effects, it is interesting to note a pattern\nin absences among the control group. Control group absences declined from the\nbaseline year to the two program years. For cohort 1, absences among the control\ngroup declined from 16.1 in the baseline year to an average of 14.1 per year over the\ntwo program years. For cohort 2, absences among the control group declined from\n14.0 in the baseline year to an average of 11.5 per year over the two program years.\nThis decline is likely a reversion to the mean since the study sample was selected\nbased on having absences within a high range in the baseline year. In the results\npresented below, the treatment effects are measured relative to the control group\nand therefore account for any mean reversion from baseline to subsequent years.\nFocusing first on days absent, the ITT estimate for cohort 1 pooled across all\ngrades is a 0.63-day reduction in absences, and the estimated TOT effect is a reduc-\ntion of 1.28 days. These pair-wise comparisons are significant at the usual 5 percent\ncutoff, but once we account for the number of tests we have carried out, there is a\nFWER-adjusted p-value of 0.23.\nHowever, these average effects mask substantial heterogeneity by age of the child.\nFor children in grades 1 to 4, the ITT and TOT effects are both close to zero. In\ncontrast, for students in grades 5 to 7, we see a TOT effect of 4.22 fewer absences; that\nis, C&C participants in these grades get nearly a week more school than their control\ngroup counterparts each year. The results for students in grades 5 to 7 are statistically\nsignificant even accounting for the number of tests, with a FWER p-value<.01. We\ncan also reject the null hypothesis that the effects are the same for students in grades\n1 to 4 versus grades 5 to 7, as shown in the rightmost column of the table. Another\nway to see that these results are not a fluke, besides our FWER-adjusted p-values,\nis that the findings replicate nearly identically in cohort 2, as shown in the second\nrow.\nTables 6 and 7 repeat this analysis for our alternative measures of school atten-\ndance, namely days present (Table 6) and percent days present (Table 7). The results\nare qualitatively similar although somewhat less precisely estimated for days present\nthan for the other outcomes.\nAs mentioned above, days present and days absent do not sum to the total number\nof days in the school year because some students either leave the CPS district or\nhave days when they are not officially enrolled at any CPS school while they are\ntransitioning from one school to another. Each day a student is officially enrolled in a\nCPS school he or she accumulates what is called a membership day.

To check\nto make sure the estimated effects on school absences are not a result of reducing the\nnumber of days students are enrolled in school, we separately examine the effect of\nparticipation in C&C on membership days and find no statistically significant effect\nfor either cohort 1 or cohort 2 or for both cohorts pooled together. When looking at\nthe percent of member days present (Table 7), we see a similar increase in percentage\nof days present.\nOne natural question is why the results look so different for relatively younger\nchildren (grades 1 to 4) versus older students (grades 5 to 7). One hypothesis is that\nwhat appears to be treatment heterogeneity by age is actually the result of differ-\nences in other student characteristics. To address this possibility, in Table A5 we\npool students in grades 1 to 4 and 5 to 7, and run a linear probability model that\nhas as the dependent variable an indicator for being in grades 5 to 7 with all of our\nbaseline characteristics (other than age) as explanatory variables.15 We then take\nthe predicted probability estimated from this model and re-weight the data using\ninverse probability weighting, so that the re-weighted average baseline characteris-\ntics for grades 1 to 4 and 5 to 7 are the same on average. This procedure essentially\nup-weights young students who look more like older students in terms of their base-\nline characteristics, and down-weights older students who look too unlike younger\nstudents. The main findings of substantial and significant heterogeneity in program\neffects by age persist.\nEffects on the Distribution of Days Absent\nThus far, we have presented results on the average number of days absent or present.\nThe pattern of effects throughout the absences distribution may be informative of\nthe mechanism by which C&C mentors help to reduce absenteeism. For example,\nC&C mentors may be most effective at identifying and remedying situations in which\nstudents are at risk for extreme absenteeism, or they may be effective at reducing\nabsences a small amount for all students.\nTable 8 examines where in the attendance distribution these effects are concen-\ntrated, by reestimating our main TOT specification but now using as the dependent\nvariable an indicator for whether a student\u2019s number of absences exceeds different\nthresholds (specifically, 5, 10, 15, or 20 days in total). The C&C effects are (when ex-\npressed as a share of the control complier mean) proportionately much larger among\nthe higher-absence students (absent more than 10 days). We show this analysis for\nour two different age groups (grades 1 to 4 versus 5 to 7) and find that, similar to\nour main results on average days absent, the effects at higher points in the absence\ndistribution are also driven by impacts on older students (those in grades 5 to 7).\nFor example, among grade 5 to 7 students in cohort 1, the estimated reduction in\nlikelihood of missing 10 or more days is -0.125, equal to 16.8 percent of the control\ncomplier mean of 0.743. For the same students, the effects on missing 20 or more\ndays is -.109, equal to 33.9 percent of the control complier mean of 0.322.\nEffects by Intervention Duration\nOne motivation for designing the intervention to be for two years was the hypoth-\nesis that the effectiveness of mentoring depends on the strength of the relationship\nbetween the student and the mentor, and the idea that relationships take time to\n15 All appendices are available at the end of this article as it appears in JPAM online.

In principle, we could learn something about how the effects for the\nthird and fourth years compare to the first and second years (as shown in Table 5),\nbut, in practice, there are just too few cohort 1 re-randomized students like this to\nmake the comparison informative, in light of the large standard errors around this\nsubgroup estimate.\nOverall these estimates are consistent with, though obviously not definitive proof\nof, the hypothesis that it may take some time for mentors and students to develop\nrelationships, and that the strength of this relationship may be an important me-\ndiator of the effectiveness of the mentoring program. A related possibility is that it\ntakes time for the C&C mentors to learn what is causing each individual student\nto be missing school, and that as the mentors recognize how they can most effec-\ntively help the student or intervene, the program\u2019s effect on absences grows. These\nare important questions for future research.\nEffects on Academic Outcomes\nWe turn now to the question of whether the C&C mentoring program gener-\nated improvements in students\u2019 academic outcomes. Among mentoring programs,\nC&C is notable in its focus on attempting to engage students in school. In ad-\ndition to the primary goal of increasing student attendance, C&C mentors are\ntasked with improving communications between students and teachers and help-\ning students to overcome things that make it hard for them to succeed while\nin school. The C&C mentors in our study varied in the strategies they used to\nhelp students. Some acted as tutors from time to time, while others drew on\ntheir backgrounds in social work and acted as case managers, advocates, and\ncounselors.\nOne might hypothesize that the increase in attendance induced by the\nC&C program may have generated improved academic outcomes. At the same\ntime, given the emphasis on school engagement beyond attendance and the\nways C&C mentors were asked to track grades and academic performance\nalongside attendance, the mentors may have had a direct effect on aca-\ndemic outcomes over and above any effect that operated through improved\nattendance.\nTables 10 and 11 present the effect on academic outcomes, including grade point\naverage (GPA), course failures, and math and reading standardized test scores.\nTable 10 presents the results pooling all grades, and Table 11 shows the TOT re-\nsults separated out by age group.17 Regardless of whether the estimates are sepa-\nrated by age or not, we do not find significant effects of C&C on students\u2019 GPA or\n17 Refer to Tables A9 and A10 in the Appendix for ITT.

cohorts.\nThe samples are for both cohorts, with each student having one observation for each year of treatment. We\ncluster at the student level because students have multiple observations, one for each year of treatment.\nStandardized MAP and Standardized Official Test refer to test scores standardized to have mean zero\nand standard deviation one. Valid MAP Data and Valid Official Data are binary variables that indicate\nwhether valid test score data is available for the student. Standardized MAP (imputed) is a variable that\nincludes imputed values when valid test scores are not available. The imputation procedure is described\nin the text. The regression covariates include: baseline days present, baseline excused absences, baseline\nunexcused absences, baseline GPA, baseline course failures, baseline age, baseline old for grade, dummy\nfor male, dummy for black, dummy for Hispanic, dummy for learning disability, and dummy for missing\nbaseline data. We include randomization block groups that are school-by-grade-by-group. In cohort 1,\nthese blocks are only school-by-grade. For cohort 2, we added block groups based on a student\u2019s original\ntreatment assignment in cohort 1. Treatment students and treatment grade columns show treatment on\nthe treated estimates.

Standardized MAP and Standardized Official Test refer to test scores standardized to have mean zeroa n d\nstandard deviation one. Valid MAP Data and Valid Official Data are binary variables that indicate whether valid test score data are available for the student.\nStandardized MAP (imputed) is a variable that includes imputed values when valid test scores are not available. The imputation procedure is describedi nt h e\ntext. The regression covariates include: baseline days present, baseline excused absences, baseline unexcused absences, baseline GPA, baseline course failures,\nbaseline age, baseline old for grade, dummy for male, dummy for black, dummy for Hispanic, dummy for learning disability, and dummy for missing baseline\ndata. We include randomization block groups that are school-by-grade-by-group. In cohort 1, these blocks are only school-by-grade. For cohort 2, weadded\nblock groups based on a student\u2019s original treatment assignment in cohort 1. We cluster at the student level because students have multiple observations, one for\neach year of treatment. Treatment students and treatment grade columns show treatment on the treated estimates.

Point estimates for these outcomes are close to zero, never statis-\ntically significant, and based on the 95-percent confidence intervals, we can rule\nout increases in the range of 0.1 to 0.15 on a standard 4-point GPA scale (or, for\ncourse failures, of a decrease any larger than about -0.13 relative to control mean\nof 0.47).\nWe also report treatment effects on reading and math achievement test scores.\nThese results are shown in the rows labeled \u201cStandardized MAP\u201d and \u201cStandard-\nized Official Test.\u201d We present results for two test-score dependent variables because\nCPS changed the test that was used for accountability purposes during the period\nwe study\u2014the Illinois Standard Achievement Test (ISAT) from 2011/2012 through\n2013/2014, and the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) in 2014/2015\u2014but ad-\nministered the MAP test throughout the time period. The \u201cStandardized MAP\u201d de-\npendent variable uses the MAP score in each year, and the \u201cStandardized Official\nTest\u201d dependent variable uses the ISAT score in the years it was used for account-\nability and the MAP score in the year it was used for accountability. As is com-\nmon, test scores are missing for some students in some years. To assess whether\ntest score missingness is associated with treatment assignment, we also estimate\nmodels with indicators for having a valid test score as the dependent variable.\nThese results are shown in the rows labeled \u201cValid MAP Data\u201d and \u201cValid Official\nData.\u201d\nTaken at face value and setting aside for the moment the size of the standard\nerrors, the estimated effects on Standardized MAP and Standardized Official Test\nseem to indicate, if anything, a slight decline in test scores as a result of C&C. But\nthe table also shows that C&C increases the likelihood that students have a valid test\nrecorded in the CPS data, presumably because they are now more likely to attend\nschool on testing days.\nTo see how this selection related to missing test scores influences our results, we\nimplement an imputation procedure for the missing data and estimate a median re-\ngression (see e.g., Brown, 1984; Chandra, 2000; and Mulligan & Rubinstein, 2008,\nfor the use of similar procedures to account for sample selection bias). We assume\nthat the students who would not show up for testing in the control condition but who\nwould if assigned to treatment have below-median test scores. We therefore impute\nfor every student with missing test scores the lowest recorded value to the test we\nsee in our data. Then we reestimate a quantile regression that examines the C&C\neffect on the median test score (the row called \u201cstandardized MAP, imputed\u201d), and\ncompare that to the results of a quantile regression that uses only data for those stu-\ndents with non-missing test scores. If we look, for example, at the \u201cpooled cohorts\u201d\npanel of Table 10, the estimated effect of C&C assignment (TOT) on the median read-\ning score of just those with valid scores is a statistically significant 0.026 (standard\nerror 0.016). If we impute below-median values for those with missing scores, the es-\ntimated effect on the median is now much smaller and no longer close to statistically\nsignificant, equal to -0.007 (standard error 0.037). We see a similar attenuation of\nthe estimated effect when we impute below-median values for missing math scores.\nBased on the Lee (2009) bounds estimates, the estimated effects range from 0.150\nto -0.167 for standardized math MAP scores and 0.163 to -0.154 for standardized\nreading MAP scores for the pooled cohorts and grades.18 From this, we conclude\nthat there is no reliable evidence in our data that C&C affected test scores, either for\nthe better or for the worse.\n18 The bound estimates are based on Lee (2009) bounds. No covariates were included to tighten the range.\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4012, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8a288cf-1fe3-4f73-bcc4-5aa31ce8e92f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8a288cf-1fe3-4f73-bcc4-5aa31ce8e92f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ecba049-1553-4dbe-bd25-5ea80ee557be", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "2070f9c67a9e7f0bc4e7fa0b77adee46a1cfa70a185b81c59a4cfc072ec6cef1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes/ 33\nTable 12.Cohort 1 balance check between schools and grades, excluding treatment students.\nControl\nGrade\nTreatment\nGrade\n(excluding\ntreatment\nstudents)\nControl\nSchool\nTreatment\nSchool\n(excluding\ntreatment\ngrade)\nStudents (n) 1112 1846 6614 1112\nBaseline Present data 150.36 150.18 150.37 150.36\nBaseline Absent data 16.1 16.13 15.69 16.1 *\nPercent Male 0.53 0.53 0.53 0.53\nAge 9.48 8.74 ** 8.97 9.48\nPercent Old for Grade 0.22 0.16 ** 0.18 0.22\nPercent Black 0.6 0.57 0.58 0.6\nPercent Hispanic 0.37 0.39 0.39 0.37\nPercent Learning Disability 0.12 0.11 0.11 0.12\nNumber of Course Failures in 2010/11 SY 0.65 0.7 0.62 0.65\nGPA in 2010/11 SY 2.23 2.21 2.24 2.23\nP-value on F-test\nWithout missing data indicators p = .515 p = .209\nWith missing data indicators p = .48 p = .213\nNotes: The length of the CPS school year changed during the study.

Because of the randomization of grade to treatment versus\ncontrol, when we analyze spillovers for grade subgroups (students in grades 1 to 4\nversus grades 5 to 7, separately), we use only those treatment schools where the\ncontrol grade was randomly assigned to be among 1 to 4 to test spillovers for stu-\ndents in grades 1 to 4, and similarly for when we test for spillovers among grade 5\nto 7 students, we only use treatment schools where the control grade was randomly\nassigned to be in the grade 5 to 7 range.\nTable 12 shows that there is balance in baseline characteristics for the control-\ngroup students in treatment versus control grades within the treatment schools, as\nwell as between control students in the treatment versus control schools. While a\nfew pair-wise comparisons are statistically significant, the F-test statistics for the\njoint hypothesis of no difference in the full set of baseline characteristics are not\nclose to statistically significant.\nTables 13 and 14 show that there are no statistically significant spillovers, either\noverall or separately for grades 1 to 4 or 5 to 7, for either school attendance and\nengagement measures, or on our measures of academic achievement. There is a\nsuggestive hint of a possible increase in absences by 1.63 days for students within\ntreatment grades assigned to the control condition (p< .01), but this result is not\nstatistically significant once we account for the number of hypothesis tests carried\nout in Table 13 (FWER p-value= 0.116).

The intervention Check & Connect seeks to\nsupplement the social capital parents can provide children to support them in school\nby assigning students to an in-school mentor. The intervention relies on providing\nyouth with a fair amount of one-on-one time with an adult whose full-time job is to\ndeliver the program; the cost per participant per year equals approximately $1,700,\nor $3,400 total over two years.\nThe program seems to be effective in improving student attendance, particularly\nfor middle-school-aged (i.e., grades 5 to 8) children. Theories of child development\nmay help explain these results. As children enter middle childhood and adolescence,\nthey are more likely to seek and obtain autonomy from their parents/guardians\nwhile simultaneously developing more meaningful relationships with peers and non-\nfamilial adults (Bandura, 1964; Eccles, 1999; Erikson, 1950). This suggests that\nCheck & Connect may have a larger impact on older youth via two potential av-\nenues: older children have more agency around school attendance decisions and\nare more open to building relationships with and seeking guidance from mentors.\nWhile the program leads to significant improvements in its primary target\noutcome\u2014attendance\u2014we find no detectable impacts on academic outcomes.\nMoreover, given the costs of the program, the size of the impacts on absences raises\nthe question of whether this intervention is the most cost-effective way to improve\nstudent attendance. One way to measure cost-effectiveness is by the cost per day\nof attendance increased. Our calculations suggest C&C costs approximately $400\nper day of improved attendance. By way of comparison, another program imple-\nmented in CPS during our study called the Chicago Attendance Project\u2014a mail-\nbased, large-scale intervention that informed CPS guardians of how many absences\ntheir student had accumulated that semester\u2014only incrementally decreased ab-\nsences, but did so at about $6 to $11 per day (Robinson et al., 2018; Rogers & Feller,\n2018).\nAnother relevant comparison is youth mentoring programs in the U.S. that use\nvolunteer mentors rather than paid, full-time employees. While these programs\ngenerally show few statistically significant impacts on academic and attendance\noutcomes (Bernstein et al., 2009; Herrera, et al., 2007), the Big Brothers Big Sis-\nters of America (BBBA) program has seen marginal decreases in unexcused ab-\nsences (Schwartz et al., 2011). Interestingly, BBBA costs are similar to those of\nC&C\u2014they average $1500 per student per year (Laura and John Arnold Foun-\ndation, 2017). One-to-one mentoring programs tend to be more expensive than\nother types of mentoring models, regardless of whether volunteer or paid men-\ntors are used (Garringer, McQuillin, & McDaniel, 2017). Future research could ex-\nplore whether less-expensive mentoring models, such as cross-age peer mentoring\nor group mentoring, could decrease costs while still providing intensive mentoring\nservices.\nOne lesson from these results may be that lower-cost, less-intensive interventions\nmay provide the most cost-effective way to improve school attendance, particu-\nlarly for marginal improvements. However, higher-cost interventions may be nec-\nessary to reduce absences by more than small amounts. One possibility is to im-\nplement a multi-tiered system of supports, where lower-cost attendance monitoring\ninterventions are applied for all students, but higher-cost interventions focused on\nbuilding social capital are provided for chronically truant students.

This procedure up-weights\nyoung students who look more like older students in terms of their baseline characteristics, and down-weights older students who look too unlike younger\nstudents.

Family-wise error rate (FWER) is the prob-\nability that a given family of tests (defined for pooled 1 to 7, and three cohort groups, cohort 1, cohort\n2, and pooled cohort 1 and 2 total, so 30 families (excluding imputed values) of outcomes are shown\nin the table) includes at least one false positive result. The FWER p-value is based on 100,000 iterations\nof randomly re-assigning the treatment-condition-within-grade indicators in our sample. The samples\nare for both cohorts, with each student having one observation for each year of treatment. The regres-\nsion covariates include: baseline days present, baseline excused absences, baseline unexcused absences,\nbaseline GPA, baseline course failures, baseline age, baseline old for grade, dummy for male, dummy for\nblack, dummy for Hispanic, dummy for learning disability, and dummy for missing baseline data. We\ninclude randomization school-level block groups. Standard errors are clustered at the grade-school level.\nFor segmented grade analysis, grades 1 to 4 and 5 to 7, we limited the sample to triple school blocks that\ninclude treatment schools within the same grade group.\n\u2217p < 0.10; **p< 0.05; ***p< 0.01.\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2173, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24768bc8-9dce-4196-a84c-d2307af2f309": {"__data__": {"id_": "24768bc8-9dce-4196-a84c-d2307af2f309", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "0", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "597d72eb-6d2c-4fb4-842b-c50367898e5f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "0", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "4eff92bc67bd199ae9ad1a68cdcdab0f9a3c2d55e863ab5498b21f07dd7b3f17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes\nTable A9.Academic impacts, by age group (pooled years, ITT estimates).\nCohort 1\nH0: Grades\n1\u20134 = Grades\nGrades 1 -

In the study sample, days present and days absent do not sum to total days in the school year because some students were not\nenrolled as CPS students or the full school year. P-value on null hypothesis that average values are jointly the same for treatment and control group comes from\nregressing treatment grade and school assignment indicator against the baseline covariates, with imputed missing values and a missing indicator for observations\nthat had missing values. All exclude treatment assigned students. Standard error is clustered at the grade-school level. Limited sample to triple school blocks that\ninclude treatment schools with control grades within the same grade group.\n\u2217p < 0.10; **p< 0.05; ***p<0.01.\nJournal of Policy Analysis and ManagementDOI: 10.1002/pam\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1619, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b004615a-9bed-4aa3-98ff-722990f13cd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b004615a-9bed-4aa3-98ff-722990f13cd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "0", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce4d1c13-7b59-4cbe-8621-80fd2818ce33", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "0", "file_name": "pam.22264.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/pam.22264.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 433635, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "548494f2e07f6716042744e72b987c5aad5484b6a15ffb36c5a62c527e273151", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Effect of Mentoring on School Attendance and Academic Outcomes\nTable A11.Spillover effects Cohort 1\u2014Main outcomes (excluding treatment students).\nGrades 1 - 4 Grades 5 - 7 All Grades\nControl\nMean\nTreatment\nGrade\nTreatment\nSchools\nControl\nMean\nTreatment\nGrade\nTreatment\nSchools\nControl\nMean\nTreatment\nGrade\nTreatment\nSchools\nDays Absent 12.532 \u22120.154 0.465 14.864 1.626\n**\n0.105 13.513 0.321 0.298\nStandard Error (0.3850) (0.3255) (0.6795) (0.4875) (0.3214) (0.2710)\nFWER p-value 0.9939 0.8027 0.3084 0.9963 0.9165 0.8865\nDays Present 158.584 0.202 \u22120.62 155.672 \u22121.798 1.216 157.305 \u22120.713 0.071\nStandard Error (0.8188) (0.6873) (1.1075) (0.8661) (0.6082) (0.5182)\nFWER p-value 0.9963 0.9296 0.7155 0.8027 0.8727 0.9963\nPercent Present 92.598 0.098 \u22120.271 91.11 \u22121.026\n**\n0.07 91.98 \u22120.233 \u22120.146\nStandard Error (0.2277) (0.1918) (0.4387) (0.3155) (0.2006) (0.1690)\nFWER p-value 0.9928 0.8027 0.33 0.9963 0.8727 0.9296\nN 9,703 5,014 18,448\nNotes: Family-wise error rate (FWER) is the probability that a given family of tests (defined for three grade groups, grades 1 to 4, 5 to 7 and pooled 1 to 7, and\nthree cohort groups, cohort 1, cohort 2, and pooled cohort 1 and 2 total, so 9 families of outcomes are shown in the table) includes at least one false positive\nresult.

Colfax Avenue, Denver, CO 80204, United States\n1. Introduction\nSocial learning theory is one of criminology's major micro-socio-\nlogical frameworks for explaining the causes of criminal and deviant\nbehavior (Sampson, 1999). According toAkers (2009), social learning\ntheory has achieved its preeminence in criminology because\u201cthe theory\ndoes well on all the major criteria by which sound theory is judge-\nd\u2014 logical consistency, scope, parsimony, testability, empirical validity,\nand usefulness\u2026 .[doing] especially well on what I consider to be the\nmost important criterion for judging a theory\u2014 empirical validity\u201d (49).\nDespite Akers' assertions, many criminologists have criticized social\nlearning theory on the grounds that the central mechan-\nism\u2014 di\ufb00erential reinforcement\u2014 has never been adequately observed,\nlet alone empirically validated (Brauer, 2009; Brauer & Tittle, 2012;\nHoran & Phillips, 2003;Krohn, 1999;Rebellon, 2006;Sampson, 1999).\nConsequently, critics argue very little is actually known about the\nmechanisms of learning that mediate one's exposure to di\ufb00erential as-\nsociations and subsequent participation in crime (e.g.,Brauer, 2009;\nBrauer & Tittle, 2012; Krohn, 1999; Rebellon, 2006; Sampson, 1999).\nAs such, it is imperative that these criticisms be addressed if social\nlearning theory is to maintain its status as one of criminology's pre-\neminent theoretical frameworks for explaining the etiology of crime.\nThe purpose of this paper is to address these criticisms by re-\nformulating social learning theory (Akers, 2009) to incorporate modern\nconceptions of learning and memory. By doing so, we are able to specify\nthe disparate learning mechanisms that might lead to criminal behavior\nat a level of accuracy and precision social learning theory currently\nlacks. Toward this end, the paper is organized into several sections.\nFirst, we provide an overview of the current statement of social learning\ntheory. Second, we discuss criticisms social learning theory has re-\nceived surrounding its concept of di\ufb00erential association and its spe-\nci\ufb01cation of how individuals learn to engage in crime. Third, we pro-\nvide a statement of social learning theory that has been retro\ufb01tt o\nincorporate and di\ufb00erentiate between nondeclarative and declarative\nforms of memory. In doing so, we also address the recent criticisms of\nthe theory. Lastly, we discuss the methodological implications of the\nretro\ufb01t model and how the importation of research methodologies from\ncognitive psychology and neuroscience can facilitate the further ela-\nboration of social learning theory.\n2. Social learning theory\nSocial learning theory (Akers, 2009) posits operant conditioning\nand vicarious reinforcement as the two primary mechanisms through\nwhich criminal behavior is learned. As a form of learning, operant\nconditioning involves instrumental behavior that is directly reinforced\nin response to a stimulus (i.e., it was rewarded or punished).

Social learning theory\nSocial learning theory (Akers, 2009) posits operant conditioning\nand vicarious reinforcement as the two primary mechanisms through\nwhich criminal behavior is learned. As a form of learning, operant\nconditioning involves instrumental behavior that is directly reinforced\nin response to a stimulus (i.e., it was rewarded or punished). Vicarious\nreinforcement is an indirect form of reinforcement in which a person\nobserves the reinforcement of another in response to a goal-relevant\nstimulus. Within social learning theory, one's di\ufb00erential exposure to\nothers and media\u2014 i.e., di\ufb00erential associations\u2014 provide individuals\nwith unique reinforcement histories that cause them to engage in or\nrefrain from criminal behavior within speci\ufb01c situations. Through these\ntwo learning mechanisms, individuals learn various\u2018de\ufb01nitions\u2019related\nto criminal behavior.\nIn di\ufb00erential association theory, the precursor to social learning\ntheory, de\ufb01nitions were de\ufb01ned as being: \u201c\u2026 (a) the techniques for\ncommitting the crime, which are sometimes very complicated, sometimes\nvery simple; (b) the speci\ufb01c direction of motives, drives, rationalizations,\nand attitudes\u201d (Sutherland, 1947:6; emphasis in original). However, the\nconcept of de\ufb01nitions has since been elaborated within social learning\ntheory (Akers, 2009) to encompass several distinct forms of cognition:\nskills, attitudes, neutralizations, and motivations for criminal behavior.\nSkills relate to knowledge about how to commit a speci\ufb01c act. Attitudes\nare normative or moral evaluative beliefs. Neutralizations are attitudes\nthat justify criminal behaviors by negating other attitudes that ordi-\nnarily prevent individuals from engaging in criminal behavior. Lastly,\nmotivations are cognitions containing information about which beha-\nviors are likely to be reinforced in speci\ufb01c situations.\nThe basic theoretical model of social learning theory is presented in\nFig. 1. Within the\ufb01gure, one's di\ufb00erential associations expose the in-\ndividual to di\ufb00erential behavioral models and reinforcements through\nwhich individuals learn de\ufb01nitions\u2014 skills, attitudes, neutralizations,\nand motivations\u2014 that are conducive to criminal behavior.

Should this matching function output a criminal behavior,\nthen a criminal behavior will be enacted.\nIt is important to note that the model of social learning theory\npresented in Fig. 1 represents a localized version of the theory that\nemphasizes one's learning history prior to encountering a criminogenic\nsituation, as well as how the products of one's learning history\u2014 one's\nde\ufb01nitions\u2014 produce criminal behavior within the situation at hand. In\ndoing so, the model neglects a full representation of the theory that\nwould necessarily include various reciprocal and feedback e\ufb00ects that\noccur continuously throughout one's life as would be present in a pro-\ncessual representation of the theory. We present this localized version\nof the theory instead in order to clearly identify the location in the\ntheory where recent critics of the theory have focused their attention.\n3. Recent criticisms of social learning theory\nOver the last twenty years, social learning theory has experienced\nrenewed criticisms relating to empirical tests of the theory (for a re-\nview, seeBrauer & Tittle, 2012). For this paper, however, two criticisms\nare particularly important: (1) the mechanisms of learning proposed by\nthe theory have not been empirically assessed; and (2) conceptual\nproblems exist in which concepts are not adequately di\ufb00erentiated from\none another.\n3.1. Lack of empirical support\nDespite claims that social learning theory possesses strong empirical\nsupport (e.g.,Akers, 2009), critics counter that few empirical tests have\nactually examined the theory's primary causal mechanisms: operant\nconditioning and vicarious reinforcement (e.g.,Brauer, 2009; Brauer &\nTittle, 2012; Krohn, 1999; Rebellon, 2006; Sampson, 1999). Moreover,\na meta-analysis of social learning theory byPratt et al. (2010)found\nthat those studies that do empirically examine these learning mechan-\nisms\ufb01nd weak or insigni\ufb01cant results. According to critics, the lack of\nempirical evidence supporting social learning theory's learning me-\nchanisms is a consequence of: (1) an absence of longitudinal research\ncapable of observing the operant conditioning mechanism (Brauer &\nTittle, 2012; Rebellon, 2006); (2) criminologists preferring to examine\ndi\ufb00erential associations and crime over direct tests of learning me-\nchanisms because of the strength of this relationship (Rebellon, 2006);\n(3) the di\ufb03culty in directly observing learning mechanisms (Brauer,\n2009); and/or (4) the paucity of secondary data that contain direct\nmeasures of reinforcements (Brauer & Tittle, 2012). Regardless of the\nreason, the general consensus of critics is that little empirical support\nexists for social learning theory's claim that reinforcement is a key\nmechanism involved in criminal behavior.\nAs further noted by social learning theory's critics, this failure to\ndirectly measure reinforcement mechanisms leaves the theory left with\nbut a handful of concepts\u2014 peers/di\ufb00erential associations and de\ufb01ni-\ntions\u2014 to explain crime, none of which are unique to social learning\ntheory. Thus, a secondary outcome stemming from the absence of direct\nempirical support for social learning theory's reinforcement mechanism\nis that any empirical support for social learning theory could also be\nseen as providing support for the many other theories that also draw\nupon these concepts (Brauer & Tittle, 2012; Gottfredson & Hirschi,\n1990; Sampson, 1999).\n3.2. Lack of conceptual di\ufb00erentiation or clarity\nThe second criticism of social learning theory relevant to this paper\nis the claim that social learning theory does not de\ufb01ne its concepts\nclearly enough to di\ufb00erentiate adequately between them. Speci\ufb01cally,\ncritics argue that social learning theory: (1) treats reinforcements and\nanticipated reinforcements as the same phenomenon; and (2) fails to\nreconcile how verbal cues or instructions square with behaviorist\nprinciples.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4171, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19034810-2c0d-4461-949e-14f2fa9f08a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "19034810-2c0d-4461-949e-14f2fa9f08a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7267ca36-4c66-4c53-bc77-cd339e4fdb2d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "445398d0ba12fd398b17d7ab1a95e216b4b6fd79c6a75c6531f1d128987e9e0c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "af9255f1-1329-43bd-82a6-6b5aad16fbb0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "b58634ef8585e99ad7fd45d46e166d2cab1eca02c1d651349249aaa89912273a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Thus, a secondary outcome stemming from the absence of direct\nempirical support for social learning theory's reinforcement mechanism\nis that any empirical support for social learning theory could also be\nseen as providing support for the many other theories that also draw\nupon these concepts (Brauer & Tittle, 2012; Gottfredson & Hirschi,\n1990; Sampson, 1999).\n3.2. Lack of conceptual di\ufb00erentiation or clarity\nThe second criticism of social learning theory relevant to this paper\nis the claim that social learning theory does not de\ufb01ne its concepts\nclearly enough to di\ufb00erentiate adequately between them. Speci\ufb01cally,\ncritics argue that social learning theory: (1) treats reinforcements and\nanticipated reinforcements as the same phenomenon; and (2) fails to\nreconcile how verbal cues or instructions square with behaviorist\nprinciples. The \ufb01rst criticism highlights that reinforcements should be\nconceptually distinguished from anticipated reinforcements since re-\ninforcement pertains to learning, and anticipated reinforcements are a\nproduct of learning (Brauer, 2009; Brauer & Tittle, 2012).\nThe second criticism relates to social learning theory's lack of\nclarity; that is, how the theory fails to reconcile how verbal cues or\ninstructions square with behaviorist principles. As noted byBrauer and\nTittle (2012), much experimental literature in behavioral analysis in-\nvolves alternative forms of learning that might involve verbal instruc-\ntions or repetition. Because experimental studies often take for granted\nthat operant conditioning plays a role in learning, operant conditioning\nmechanisms are not actually measured. As such, it remains unclear\nwhether operant conditioning or another possible form of learning is\noccurring in the investigation.\n4. Retro\ufb01tting social learning theory\nA signi\ufb01cant shortcoming of the previous criticisms is the taken for\ngranted assumption that operant conditioning and/or vicarious re-\ninforcement are actually the primary mechanisms whereby criminal\nbehavior is learned (cf:Brauer & Tittle, 2012), let alone whether re-\ninforcement-based forms of learning are congruent with modern un-\nderstandings of learning present within cognitive psychology and\nFig. 1.Basic model of social learning theory.\nK.R.

As noted byProctor and Niemeyer (2019), social learning\ntheory's conception of learning is antiquated as a consequence of its\nreliance on behaviorism, S-R-S chains, and black boxing of the brain\nand mind. Central to Proctor and Niemeyer's claim is that social\nlearning theory curiously omits any discussion of memory or the neu-\nroanatomy and physiology of learning and memory, two areas where\nprofound scienti\ufb01c discoveries have occurred in cognitive psychology\nand neuroscience over the last\ufb01fty years.\nThis description of social learning theory might appear somewhat at\nodds with elaborations of the theory which havesubstantively moved\nthe theory away from the strict form of behaviorism present in the\ntheory's original statement byBurgess and Akers (1966). As noted by\nAkers (2009), the original statement of the theory in the form of dif-\nferential association-reinforcement theory relied on an orthodox inter-\npretation of behaviorism that eschewed mental or cognitive phe-\nnomena. Later elaborations of the theory reemphasized the theory's\nroots within symbolic interactionism and represented a form of social\nbehaviorism that reattended to the signi\ufb01cance of cognitions in its ex-\nplanation of crime, which meant the theory was more congruent with\nthe social learning theory of Bandura than the radical behaviorism of\nSkinner (Akers, 2009).\nWhile Akers' version of social learning theory broke with radical\nbehaviorism in regard to its substance, this break did not re\ufb02ect a\ncomplete departure from behaviorism's failure to recognize the etiolo-\ngical role of the central nervous or its properties or characteristics in\nregard to behavior. Thus, while behaviorism's black box was opened to\nallow the presence of cognitions in the form of de\ufb01nitions in social\nlearning theory's explanations of crime, de\ufb01nitions themselves were\ntreated as discriminative stimuli (Akers, 2009) that were not tied to any\nunderlying neurological foundation. Consequently, the elaborated form\nof social learning theory explained the activities involved in learning\n(i.e., S-R-S chains) and the content of what was learned (i.e., de\ufb01ni-\ntions) but did not illuminate the black box of the mind in terms of how\ncognitions might be stored in memory, as well as the neuroanatomy and\nphysiology involved in forming memories.\nSocial learning theory's continued reliance on behaviorism in this\nregard has meant the theory focuses on the behavioral activities in-\nvolved in learning and ignores the properties or characteristics of the\ncentral nervous system that in \ufb02uence the learning processes and\nmemory. As noted byTerry (2016), throughout the twentieth century,\nbehaviorists were primarily concerned with learning as an activity,\nwhich they conceived in terms of conditioning and reinforcement. The\nconcept of memory was examined separately within cognitive psy-\nchology and therefore neglected by behaviorism (Terry, 2016). Conse-\nquently, behaviorism was unconcerned with how learning related to\nretention of the things learned, and this omission of discussions of\nmemory remains within the contemporary statement of social learning\ntheory.\nTo address the criticisms of social learning theory that have been\nsummarized thus far, we contend the theory must: (1) incorporate\ncontemporary understandings of learning and memory; and (2)\nabandon behaviorism as an underlying paradigm.\n4.1. Contemporary understandings of learning and memory\nThe basic learning model within social learning theory has become\noutmoded compared to understandings of learning and memory present\nwithin cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Within these \ufb01elds,\nlearning is \u201cthe process of acquiring new and relatively enduring in-\nformation, behavior patterns, or abilities, characterized by modi\ufb01ca-\ntions of behavior as a result of practice, study, or experience \u201d\n(Breedlove & Watson, 2013:512). Memory is typically de\ufb01ned as either:\n(1) the ability to retain and retrieve information, behavior patterns, or\nabilities\nacross some interval of time, or (2) the actual information,\nbehavior patterns, or abilities stored within the brain (Terry, 2016).\nCritical to addressing critics of social learning theory, though, is the fact\nthat numerous forms of memory have been discovered to exist, with\neach possessing its own unique productive mechanisms.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4325, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4351afc-37a0-4092-9ab4-312415518ede": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4351afc-37a0-4092-9ab4-312415518ede", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4dcd2e74-2100-4e6b-aa71-9beeaa05d5ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "425f001b9dcd9e7f6b3956c4edeb056768cc7814b06618712a13d639e21e24c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2eb3f75a-e83c-4a4b-bfb4-6eee1dc0e17a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "3170e19a6f49e9bb0886291cfcce584b50a1f52d955062318fd0fa2bf59695f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9211d7b8-ffdd-4b44-a5ed-8853ab0ab8a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "075416d5d01386fc8b29ed8bb8cab3be6a657b61b87aa97a9d7ce5cc061ef90b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Within these \ufb01elds,\nlearning is \u201cthe process of acquiring new and relatively enduring in-\nformation, behavior patterns, or abilities, characterized by modi\ufb01ca-\ntions of behavior as a result of practice, study, or experience \u201d\n(Breedlove & Watson, 2013:512).

It is important\nto note that various forms of learning and memory can co-occur; thus,\nthe presence of one form of learning and memory can a\ufb00ect the me-\nchanisms that generate other forms of learning and memory (Jeansok &\nBaxter, 2001). Due to space constraints, we limit our discussions of\nnondeclarative and declarative memory to those forms that directly\nrelate to the current statement of social learning theory.\n4.1.1. Nondeclarative memory\nWithin cognitive psychology and neuroscience, nondeclarative\nmemory is a class of memory that isnot consciously accessible to in-\ndividuals. Regarding social learning theory, two types of nondeclarative\nmemory are particularly important: skills and conditioned behaviors.\n4.1.1.1. Skills. Skills are a form of memory that enable individuals to\ndeliberately interact with their environments to produce a desired\nchange (Gluck, Mercado, & Myers, 2016;Rudy, 2014). Thus, skills are\ninstrumental. Skills include cognitive skills, motor skills, and visual-\nmotor skills. Cognitive skills re\ufb02ect the ability to hold and manipulate\nlarge quantities of information (Terry, 2016), motor skills enable one\nengage in precise muscle movements (Kellogg, 2016), and visual-motor\nskills relate to motors skills that are directed by sensory inputs (Gluck\net al., 2016:312). Two types of skills\u2014 actions and habits\u2014 have been\nidenti\ufb01ed by cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists (Rudy, 2014).\nAlthough actions and habits are learned and deployed using di\ufb00erent\nneural systems and often compete with one another during behavioral\ntasks, research clearly shows actions and habits do often operate in\ntandem to allow for complex forms of behavior (Kool, Cushman, &\nGershman, 2018; Wood & R\u00fcnger, 2016).\nActions are comprised of a consciously present goal that is deliber-\nately pursued through a course of behavior believed to achieve the\ndesired goal. Generally speaking, actions are characterized by three\nproperties: (1) teleological determination; (2) conscious selection; and\n(3) cognitive oversight ( Dolan & Dayan, 2013 ). Actions are tele-\nologically determined in that the presence of a desired goal determines\ntheir content and structure. Actions are consciously selected in that they\nare deliberately chosen based upon preexisting knowledge about which\nbehaviors are likely to be e\ufb00ective for attaining the desired goal. In\nhumans, this preexisting knowledge, which is commonly referred to as\nan internal model (Doll, Duncan, Simon, Shohamy, & Daw, 2015), can\nstem from previous conditioned learning and/or reinforcement\nlearning, as well as from deliberately recalled personal experience (i.e.,\nepisodic memory), and/or symbolic knowledge related to the goal (i.e.,\nsemantic memory) (Behrens et al., 2018; Gershman & Daw, 2017;\nRadulescu, Niv, & Ballard, 2019). Actions are consciously monitored to\nthe\ndegree that the outcomes resulting from the performed actions are\ndeliberately compared to the expected outcome generated by the se-\nlected model (Dezfouli & Balleine, 2013; Dolan & Dayan, 2013).\nThe neural mechanism underlying cognitive oversight is called the\naction system and is comprised of the prefrontal cortex, sensory sys-\ntems, association areas that combine various sensory inputs, motor\nareas, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, and the spinal cord.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3616, "end_char_idx": 7812, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9211d7b8-ffdd-4b44-a5ed-8853ab0ab8a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "9211d7b8-ffdd-4b44-a5ed-8853ab0ab8a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4dcd2e74-2100-4e6b-aa71-9beeaa05d5ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "425f001b9dcd9e7f6b3956c4edeb056768cc7814b06618712a13d639e21e24c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4351afc-37a0-4092-9ab4-312415518ede", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "5b9149ae2aa17f890fa2db0f006e29aa2283b09f297dd307976d656f81a63f9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Actions are consciously monitored to\nthe\ndegree that the outcomes resulting from the performed actions are\ndeliberately compared to the expected outcome generated by the se-\nlected model (Dezfouli & Balleine, 2013; Dolan & Dayan, 2013).\nThe neural mechanism underlying cognitive oversight is called the\naction system and is comprised of the prefrontal cortex, sensory sys-\ntems, association areas that combine various sensory inputs, motor\nareas, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, and the spinal cord.

The basal ganglia then evaluates the motor\nplan for its appropriateness to the situation (Freberg, 2016; Garrett,\n2015). Should the motor plan be deemed appropriate, the basal ganglia\nsuppresses alternate motor plans and releases the appropriate motor\nplan to the primary motor cortex, which then releases a signal to enact\nthe plan to the spinal cord. The spinal cord then releases the signal to\nthe muscles, which then directly enact the motor plan. Within this\nmechanism, the cerebellum prepares other parts of a person's body to\nassist in executing the action (e.g., maintaining one's visual focus on the\nobject with which one is interacting).\nOnce a motor plan is enacted, the action system examines sensory\nfeedback to determine if the expected outcome occurred as predicted by\nthe internal model. If the expected outcome did occur, the enacted\nmotor plan is reinforced and is more likely to be enacted in the future\nunder similar conditions. Should the motor plan fail, the resulting\nprediction error will motivate a person to consciously try to identify the\nsource of the failure and generate a new motor plan based upon a new\nmental model.\nThe internal model and the conscious monitoring of actions should\nnot be confused with the cognitive skills, motor skills, and visual-motor\nskills themselves. Whereas cognitive oversight is a deliberate and con-\nscious process, the actual skills involved in an action are a form of\nnondeclarative memory that are produced through operant con-\nditioning.\nOperant conditioning involves a three-way association and temporal\nsequence between a discriminative stimulus, a response, and an out-\ncome (Gluck et al., 2016:172). Within this sequence, discriminative\nstimuli signal to an individual that a particular response will likely\nresult in the achievement of a goal. Following one's exposure to dis-\ncriminant stimuli, the individual selects a response to employ in pursuit\nof a goal and enacts it. Lastly, the outcome of one's response serves as\neither a reward when the goal is attained or a punishment when the\ngoal is not attained. Responses that are rewarded are more likely to be\nenacted in future encounters involving the same goal and discriminant\nstimuli, while responses that are punished are less likely to be enacted\nunder conditions similar to the original situation. Despite the conscious\nelements present within an action surrounding need states, goals that\nsatisfy need states, expected rewards, and the potential presence of\nnorms that might in\ufb02uence action selection, the particular skills in-\nvolved in an action are stored within memory as motor plans located in\nthe motor areas of the brain and cannot be consciously manipulated or\naccessed, which is why actions are considered a nondeclarative form of\nmemory (Gluck et al., 2016).\nIf an action is repeatedly and consistently rewarded within the\npresence of the same discriminant stimuli in relation to a goal, the\nspeci\ufb01c set of behaviors employed in the teleological pursuit of a goal\nbecome fused together into a single form of memory\u2014 a habit. Habits\ncause speci\ufb01c actions to automatically occur and execute until com-\npletion when a person encounters discriminant stimuli that were pre-\nsent within past situations where a goal was repeatedly achieved (Rudy,\n2014).\nThe habitual behavior enacted in relation to habits possesses two\ncharacteristics that distinguish it from actions. First, habitual behaviors\nare triggered mainly in response to the presence of discriminate stimuli\nwithin a situation (Neal, Wood, Labrecque, & Lally, 2012). They are not\nguided by goals, and therefore cannot be seen as being deliberate or\nintentional. For this reason, habits are also referred to as model-free\n(Doll et al., 2015). Second, habits are enacted without regard to the\nreinforcement values of their outcomes ( Gluck et al., 2016; Rudy,\n2014). Habitual behavior occurs regardless of whether an outcome is\nrewarded, punished, or neutral in its reinforcement value (for a review,\nsee W.Wood & R\u00fcnger, 2016). Further, the mechanisms involved in\nactions and habitual behavior possess di\ufb00erences in the way subregions\nof the basal ganglia interact with subregions of the frontal cortex\n(Adachi & Willoughby, 2011; Ashby, Turner, & Horvitz, 2010;\nLanciego,\nLuquin, & Obeso, 2012).\n4.1.1.2.

Conditioned behaviors . Conditioned behavior refers to the\nretained and retrievable patterns of behavior that are acquired/\nlearned through the classical conditioning process. As a form of\nnondeclarative memory, conditioned behavior is not consciously\naccessible to actors. However, unlike operant behavior, which requires\nan organism to engage with the environment actively for learning to\noccur, conditioned behavior is learned passively. In other words, an\norganism does not need toact upon the environment for learning to\noccur. Instead, the organism need only be exposed to contingently\npaired stimuli in order for a conditioned behavior to form. The exact\nregions of the brain involved in the mechanism of classical conditioning\nvary depending upon the nature of the stimuli involved. Nonetheless,\nthey generally include various sensory cortices, the hypothalamus, the\nthalamus, the amygdala, the cerebellum, and the brainstem\n(Fredrikson, Wik, Fischer, & Andersson, 1995 ; Kim & Jung, 2006;\nSquire & Dede, 2015).\nConditioned behavior and the classical conditioning process were\ndiscovered by the Russian physiologist, Ivan Pavlov, as a part of his\nresearch on the causes and consequences of salivation during digestion\nin dogs (Todes, 1997). Stated in simple terms, classical conditioning is\nthe process by which an otherwise insigni\ufb01cant stimulus automatically\nbecomes meaningful to an organism over time as the organism re-\npeatedly experiences the insigni\ufb01cant stimulus in conjunction with a\nsecond stimulus that the organism already \ufb01nds meaningful. Within\nclassical conditioning, a stimulus is de\ufb01ned as any object or environ-\nmental event, whether it be internal or external to the organism, that\nelicits a response (Lefran\u00e7ois, 2012). A response is de\ufb01ned as any ex-\nternally visible and highly coordinated pattern of sensory, muscular,\nglandular, neural, and endocrine activity that occurs as a consequence\nof being exposed to a stimulus (Lefran\u00e7ois, 2012; Levitis, Lidicker, &\nFreund, 2009). An insigni\ufb01cant stimulus, in turn, is any stimulus that\ndoes not normally elicit a speci\ufb01c set of patterned of responses\u2014 other\nthan, perhaps, gaining the organism's attention\u2014 while a meaningful\nstimulus is one that does elicit a set of stereotypical responses\n(Lefran\u00e7ois, 2012).\nWithin the classical conditioning framework, insigni\ufb01cant stimuli\nare called neutral stimuli, and meaningful stimuli are called uncondi-\ntioned stimuli. Initially, Pavlov used the Russian word for unconditional\nto describe unconditioned stimuli because of the stimuli's ability to\nunconditionally elicit the associated set of patterned responses (Todes,\n2014). Likewise, Pavlov called the set of responses associated with\nunconditioned stimuli unconditional responses because the responses\nunconditionally resulted from the organism's exposure to the uncondi-\ntional\nstimulus.

Episodic memory. Episodic memory is declarative memory for\nspatiotemporally speci \ufb01c events individuals experience \ufb01rst-\nhand\u2014 including the details of the event, as well as the thoughts and\nvisceral sensations experienced while perceiving these details (Cohen,\nPoldrack, & Eichenbaum, 1997; Diana & Wang, 2018; Eichenbaum,\n2004; Naya, 2016;Teyler & Rudy, 2007). Like nondeclarative memory,\nthe mechanism for creating episodic memory can be speci\ufb01ed at both a\npsycho-behavioral level and a neurological level of explanation (Diana\n& Wang, 2018 ). At the psycho-behavioral level, the mechanism\ngenerating episodic memory is divided into three phases: encoding,\nstorage, and retrieval. Numerous factors are known to a \ufb00ect the\nencoding, storage, and retrieval of episodic memory individually\n(Diana & Wang, 2018), and creating precise theories of learning and\nmemory requires accounting for these di\ufb00erent phases and how each\nmay be a\ufb00ected by these various factors.\nEncoding is the initial process by which a perceived experience is\ntransformed into a lasting memory. Encoding consists of forming the\ncontextual associations between the properties that de\ufb01ne a speci\ufb01c\nevent, boundaries between the event and other similar or related\nevents, and various retrieval cues that enable individuals to retrieve the\nmany remembered aspects of a single event. Encoding is particularly\nsensitive to the amount of attention an individual gives to an aspect of\nan event (Diana & Wang, 2018). During storage, recently encoded\nmemories are transformed over time into more durable and long-lasting\nrepresentations; it is also during this time that individual episodic\nmemories are organized and cross-referenced based on shared attri-\nbutes and other similarities. Retrieval is when a stored episodic memory\nis actively recalled. Research indicates episodic memories are stored as\ncomposites of the attributes that de\ufb01 ne an event, not as an un-\ndi\ufb00erentiated whole. Consequently, the retrieval of episodic memory\nconsists of reconstituting the remembered event from the individual\nstored elements that comprise it (Diana & Wang, 2018). As such, re-\ntrieval of episodic memory can be a\ufb00ected when spurious or\ufb01ctitious\nelements are incorrectly included in the reconstitution of the re-\nmembered event (Diana & Wang, 2018).\nFurther research is needed to specify the neurological mechanisms\nthat fully enable the encoding, storage, and retrieval; it is generally\nacknowledged that the medial temporal lobe plays an essential role\n(Diana & Wang, 2018; Squire & Dede, 2015). Extensive animal and\nhuman research shows that the medial temporal lobe can be divided\ninto a number of structurally, and functionally distinct regions, in-\ncluding the hippocampus, entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal\ncortices\n(Diana & Wang, 2018; Squire & Dede, 2015), which are hier-\narchically organized in terms of information\ufb02ow between them. In one\ntheoretical model (Diana & Wang, 2018), the perirhinal cortex receives\nvisual information about what an object is, and the parahippocampal\ncortex receives visual information about the object's physical location.\nBoth sets of information are then projected to the hippocampus, which\nintegrates the content of each to create the object-object and object-\ncontext associations that de\ufb01ne an episodic event (Diana & Wang,\n2018).\n4.1.2.2.

Semantic memory . Semantic memory contains general\nknowledge, which is devoid of the situational knowledge present in\nepisodic memory (Squire & Dede, 2015). This allows individuals to\narrive at generalizations of meaning through repeated exposure to\ninformation within the environment, which produces abstract\nknowledge such as schemas ( Rudy, 2014; Yee, Jones, & McRae,\n2018). The schemas stored as semantic memory are organized into\ntaxonomies or thematic relationships, and a given schema can be\nsimultaneously organized into both types (Jackson, Ho\ufb00man, Pobric, &\nLambon Ralph, 2015). Taxonomies involve categorization based upon\nshared attributes among schemas and intra-class memberships to\nabstract categories (e.g., di \ufb00erent types of handguns). Thematic\nrelationships relate to the spatial and temporal associations present\nbetween schemas pertaining to two or more di\ufb00erent things, such as the\nlink between \u2018soldiers\u2019and \u2018assault ri\ufb02es,\u2019 which are bound by their\nspatiotemporal co-occurrence. Extensive research indicates that the\nanterior temporal lobe and angular gyrus are critical brain regions\ninvolved in creating and maintaining these abstraction representations\n(Yee et al., 2018).\nResearchers hypothesize there are at least three possible mechan-\nisms producing semantic memories (Yee et al., 2018). In the\ufb01rst pro-\nposed mechanism, semantic information is initially stored in the brain\nas episodic memory. Over time, as the information is repeatedly ex-\nperienced across multiple events, the memory becomes generalized as\nthe various properties unique to each event are abstracted away in\nfavor of the common elements. The second proposed mechanism argues\nthat semantic memory is created directly from experience by encoding\nonly the general features of an event and ignoring the various idio-\nsyncratic features. The third hypothesis proposes that semantic memory\nis most e\ufb03ciently derived from episodic memory, but that semantic\nmemory can also be derived directly from experience slowly and over\nmany, many repeated experiences.\n4.1.2.3. Autobiographical memory. Autobiographical memory is a form\nof self-relevant memory that contains properties of both episodic and\nsemantic memory (Renoult et al., 2016; Renoult, Davidson, Palombo,\nMoscovitch, & Levine, 2012). In regard to episodic memory, it contains\ninformation about one's self within a given historical experience and the\nrelevance of the experience to the individual. In regard to semantic\nmemory, autobiographical memory contains self-relevant information\nthat\nis generalized in nature and lacks contextual details, with such\ninformation partially serving as the basis of identities (seeNiemeyer,\n2013).\nResearchers have yet to fully elucidate the exact nature of auto-\nbiographical memory ( Gilboa, Rosenbaum, & Mendelsohn, 2018);\nhowever, a growing body of empirical evidence suggests at least three\nbasic characteristics. First, although episodic and semantic auto-\nbiographical memory appear to be encoded using similar brain regions\nas other forms of declarative memory, they nonetheless appear distinct\nfrom more general forms of episodic and semantic memory (Brown,\nRissman, Chow, Uncapher, & Wagner, 2018;Chen, Gilmore, Nelson, &\nMcDermott, 2017; Ramanan, 2017). Second, autobiographical mem-\nories are not directly recalled in the same form that they are ultimately\nexperienced by those recalling them (Svoboda, McKinnon, & Levine,\n2006). Instead, autobiographical memories appear to be actively con-\nstructed from more basic declarative memories (including episodic and\nsemantic memories) ( Inman, James, Vytal, & Hamann, 2018;\nMcCormick, Moscovitch, Valiante, Cohn, & McAndrews, 2018; Svoboda\net al., 2006).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3353, "end_char_idx": 7494, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "847f82a8-1621-450b-ba7a-1f7412038dfd": {"__data__": {"id_": "847f82a8-1621-450b-ba7a-1f7412038dfd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "31fa8a41-c38b-4826-abf3-65f962672438", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "be9da97b0827d2a2bde94ffc4b6585a886eed6f3211a1ce5fa4b751b14b478ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0d08893-5471-43f5-b054-1aa9e72c4267", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "b6685b3ccb8b3e687c92fd20be872045ddf6cd15873c6f80f0b75a8beed47378", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Second, autobiographical mem-\nories are not directly recalled in the same form that they are ultimately\nexperienced by those recalling them (Svoboda, McKinnon, & Levine,\n2006).

Third, the construction of an autobiographical memory\nappears to rely on other cognitive processes such as theory of mind,\nworking memory, and the ability to construct a narrative (Andrews-\nHanna, Saxe, & Yarkoni, 2014 ; Goddard, Dritschel, Robinson, &\nHowlin, 2014).\nThe regions of the brain involved in the mechanism of auto-\nbiographical memory vary depending upon how an autobiographical\nmemory is being recalled, what is being recalled, and for what reason\n(Sheldon et al., 2018).

Theoretical retro\ufb01tting of social learning theory\nThe current statement of social learning theory, with its reliance on\nbehaviorism as an underlying paradigm, lacks the conceptual frame-\nwork required to respond adequately to its critics. We contend ques-\ntions surrounding the theory's empirical validity and conceptual clarity\nare best addressed by\ufb01rst retro\ufb01tting the theory with modern under-\nstandings of learning and memory present within cognitive psychology\nand neuroscience, as this greatly enhances conceptual clarity within the\ntheory and allows for more meaningful future tests of it. The retro\ufb01t\nmodel of social learning theory is presented inFig. 2. In the sections\nthat follow, we describe each element of the proposed revision, as well\nas identify how the retro\ufb01t models address the aforementioned criti-\ncisms of the theory.\n5.1. Di\ufb00erential associations\nWithin the retro\ufb01t social learning model, the concept of di\ufb00erential\nassociations is retained, which includes associations individuals have\nwith others, as well as interactions one has with various forms of media\n(Akers, 2009). Like the current statement of social learning theory\n(Akers, 2009), one's di\ufb00erential associations are also seen within the\nretro\ufb01t model as being the primary context within which the various\nmechanisms of learning occur.\n5.2. Learning mechanisms and memories\nThe retro\ufb01t model of social learning posits that one's di\ufb00erential\nassociations lead to criminal behavior through multiple distinct, but\npossibly co-occurring forms of learning which produce distinct forms of\nmemory. These include actions and habits, conditioned behaviors, se-\nmantic memories, episodic memories, and autobiographical memories.\nThe retro\ufb01t model abandons the concept of de\ufb01nitions as it is currently\nde\ufb01ned because it con\ufb02ates di\ufb00erent forms of memory, the majority of\nwhich are not produced through operant conditioning or vicarious re-\ninforcement.\n5.2.1. Actions and habits\nSocial learning theory (Akers, 2009) contends individuals acquire\nthe skills necessary to engage in crime through operant conditioning or\nvicarious reinforcement. The theory's emphasis on skills is directly de-\nrived from its origins within di\ufb00erential association theory, where\nSutherland (1947, [1942] 1956) contended individuals learned the\ntechniques (i.e., skills) required to engage in criminal behavior, which\ncould be either simple or complex in nature. A key component of Su-\ntherland's conception of skills was that the skills involved in criminal\nbehavior were often also skills involved in non-criminal behavior\n(Sutherland, 1942 1956). Within the retro\ufb01t model, the concept of skills\nis respeci\ufb01ed as a form of nondeclarative memory that includes actions\nand habits. The ability to engage in criminalactions is learned through\none's criminogenic di\ufb00erential associations through two distinct, but\nintertwined, forms of learning: operant and vicarious operant con-\nditioning. Through operant conditioning, people learn to engage in\ncriminal actions as a result of being rewarded or punished for engaging\nin a speci\ufb01c action in response to a stimulus. Criminalhabits are ac-\nquired through the repeated engagement in and rewarding of criminal\nactions.\nOur review of contemporary de\ufb01nitions of learning and memory\nreveals social learning theory (Akers, 2009) contains several problems\nin its conception of operating conditioning. First, social learning theory\ndoes not su\ufb03ciently di\ufb00erentiate between actions and habits, recognize\ndistinctions in their productive mechanisms, or di\ufb00erentiate between\nFig. 2.Retro\ufb01t social learning theory model.\nK.R.

Second, social learning\ntheory's conception of imitation as a distinct form of learning is in-\ncorrect regarding actions. As noted byBandura (1971), \u201c[the] operant\nconditioning analysis of modeling phenomena [e.g., imitation]\u2026 relies\nentirely upon the standard three-component paradigm Sd \u2794 R \u2794 Sr ,\nwhere Sd denotes the modeled stimulus, R represents an overt matching\nresponse, and Sr designates the reinforcing stimulus\u201d (xix). Thus, vi-\ncarious reinforcement is a special case of operant conditioning, one\nmore appropriately labeled vicarious operant conditioning.\nVicarious operant conditioning occurs through a general process of\nsensorimotor-based intersubjective resonance, whereby observed ac-\ntions performed by another trigger an individual to unconsciously recall\none's motor plan related to the observed act (Herbert, Lafargue, Moritz-\nGasser, Bonnetblanc, & Du\ufb00au, 2015). The motor plan recalled includes\nthe motions, actions, and immediate goals involved in the observed\nbehavior, with motions relating to speci\ufb01c body movements, actions\ninvolving integrations of motions in reference to a target object, and\nimmediate goals pertaining to the consequences of the action\n(Schaafsma, Pfa\ufb00, Spunt, & Adolphs, 2015;Spunt, Falk, & Lieberman,\n2010; Van Overwalle & Baetens, 2009). Vicarious operant conditioning\noccurs when an individual observes the actions of another in relation to\nan object, recalls motor plans related to the actions of the observed\nindividual through sensorimotor-based resonance, and observes the\nindividual achieve a speci\ufb01c immediate goal as a consequence of the\nperson's actions (Monfardini et al., 2013). In terms of the three-part\nsequence, Bandura (1971) describes\u2014 Sd \u2794 R \u2794 Sr\u2014 the term Sd re-\npresents the observed modeled action, R represents the process of\nsensorimotor-based intersubjective resonance, and Sr represents the\nobserved reinforcing stimulus. Through this mechanism, the observer\ncomes to associate speci\ufb01c motor plans with speci\ufb01c immediate goals\nby observing the actions of another being reinforced.\nThe magnitude of vicarious operant learning varies across in-\ndividuals based on at least two conditions ( Kibler & Shea, 2005;\nSumanapala & Cross, 2017). First, the magnitude is greater when ob-\nservers already possess the various motor plans that either directly or\nclosely corresponded to one or more aspects of the actions engaged in\nby the observed individual (Eaves, Emerson, Binks, Scott, & Kenny,\n2018; Kirsch & Cross, 2015; Sumanapala, Fish, Jones, & Cross, 2017).\nSecond, vicarious learning is more e\ufb00ective when individuals explicitly\npractice the observed action so that the behavioral sequence can be\nconsolidated into a single motor plan through operant conditioning\n(Eaves et al., 2018; Ossmy & Mukamel, 2018;Spampinato & Celnik,\n2018; Vogt & Thomaschke, 2007).\nOperant conditioning can also occur through observational learning\n(Maslovat, Hayes, Horn, & Hodges, 2010). In observational learning, a\nmodel formallydemonstrates the action to an observing individual, asks\nthe observing individual to repeat the demonstrated action, and pro-\nvides positive and negative feedback to the observing individual as he\nor she practices what was observed. Here, the term Sd represents the\nmodel formally demonstrating the action, R represents the individual\nformally practicing the action while being observed by the model, and\nSr represents the reinforcing stimulus provided by the model in re-\nsponse to the individual's performance of the action.\nIn a study examining tutelage within di\ufb00erential association theory,\nMcCarthy (1996) found a signi \ufb01cant association between tutelage\n(having someone o\ufb00er to help engage in crime, actually help engage in\ncrime, or tell the respondent how to make money o\ufb00 crime) and drug\ndealing and theft. While the study lacks su\ufb03cient precision to de-\ntermine whether vicarious reinforcement or observational learning\nwere associated with crime as forms of tutelage, nonetheless, the evi-\ndence suggests that either form of learning could play a signi\ufb01cant role\nin the learning of criminal behavior.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4147, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67a96753-a846-4391-bfb9-39bb4b3d3984": {"__data__": {"id_": "67a96753-a846-4391-bfb9-39bb4b3d3984", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0025e7f-8a7a-48bf-b766-60b542b35233", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "f4713aadb37746739abbd36122a48e2c6d5eafb6f4ea88ac4657da553cac31c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f76c3625-16b5-4509-bb65-9afcc2ea9774", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "5d0af1398be254086033e53d7053ee25c4825ffb6a8e863af347857c81e71f5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0b1f2c06-6164-4621-a14c-beeddf78021a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "374182321b64ffdcce6ed51f7ee02023a6b17520969e0d19d7a06796929ed527", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Here, the term Sd represents the\nmodel formally demonstrating the action, R represents the individual\nformally practicing the action while being observed by the model, and\nSr represents the reinforcing stimulus provided by the model in re-\nsponse to the individual's performance of the action.\nIn a study examining tutelage within di\ufb00erential association theory,\nMcCarthy (1996) found a signi \ufb01cant association between tutelage\n(having someone o\ufb00er to help engage in crime, actually help engage in\ncrime, or tell the respondent how to make money o\ufb00 crime) and drug\ndealing and theft.

The retro\ufb01t model speci\ufb01es that the skills necessary\nto commit a crime can be learned through three distinct but related\nmechanisms: operant conditioning, vicarious operant conditioning, and\nobservational learning. Unlike operant conditioning, which entails in-\nstrumental learning through trial and error, vicarious operant con-\nditioning and observational learning represent guided means for\nlearning a skill. Whereas vicarious operant conditioning is passive, in-\nvolving no interaction with another demonstrating the use of a skill to\nachieve a desired goal, observational learning involves direct interac-\ntion and tutelage.\nThe retro\ufb01t statement of social theory also allows criminologists to\ndistinguish empirically between instruction-based operant learning and\npurely operant learning, something that critics (Brauer & Tittle, 2012)\nargue is currently impossible within the classic social learning theory\nframework. As noted earlier when introducing the concept of actions,\nthe internal models generated by the action system and stored in\nworking memory create both a set of expectations about how the im-\nmediate situation should change if the proper response is performed,\nand a corresponding set of behaviors for achieving the outcome. As also\nwas noted, internal models are built-up from various forms of memory\nthat were learned during previous experiences in similar situations.\nAccording to recent research, though, the semantic knowledge stored in\nan individual's memory that is triggered by the verbal instructions can\nboth populate the individual's internal model and provide the same\nfunction as memories learned from previous direct experience (Doll\net al., 2015; Redish, 2016). Despite their functional equivalence within\ninternal models, verbal instructions can nonetheless be empirically\ndistinguished through a variety of research technologies (see, e.g.,\nLauren Y. Atlas, 2019;L .Y . Atlas, Doll, Li, Daw, & Phelps, 2016).\nConsequently, the retro\ufb01t statement of social learning theory gives\ncriminologists the ability to both conceptually and empirically assess if,\nwhen, and how verbal instructions facilitate deviant behavior under\ndi\ufb00erent situational contexts.\n5.2.2. Conditioned behaviors\nWhile social learning theory (Akers, 2009) acknowledges the ex-\nistence of classical conditioning, the theory contends it is not important\nfor explaining criminal behavior. Contrary to this claim, however,\nclassical conditioning can be a powerful source of learning criminal\nmotivations; one example of this is vicarious classical conditioning.\nVicarious classical conditioning involves classical conditioning and\nemotional contagion, a process mediated by the mirror neuron system\nthat allows individuals to automatically simulate the emotions of others\n(Harada, Hayashi, Sadato, & Iidaka, 2016; Nummenmaa, Hirvonen,\nParkkola, & Hietanen, 2008). The automatic simulation of the emotions\nof others occurs through the previously discussed mechanism of sen-\nsorimotor-based intersubjective resonance, which produces a low-level\nunderstanding of the emotional states of others (Keysers & Gazzola,\n2014).\nEmotional contagion is possible, in part, because the physical mo-\ntions involved in expressing emotions, such as smiling, involve motor\nplans. The mechanism producing emotional contagion involves: (1) an\nobserver; (2) a person being observed; and (3) a physical display of\nemotion, typically on one's face, by the person being observed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3268, "end_char_idx": 7833, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b1f2c06-6164-4621-a14c-beeddf78021a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b1f2c06-6164-4621-a14c-beeddf78021a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0025e7f-8a7a-48bf-b766-60b542b35233", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "f4713aadb37746739abbd36122a48e2c6d5eafb6f4ea88ac4657da553cac31c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "67a96753-a846-4391-bfb9-39bb4b3d3984", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "d4edbe61f309bcf134e6038fd0ca86337d29b72a189ebe0e430b6f5757cd57d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The automatic simulation of the emotions\nof others occurs through the previously discussed mechanism of sen-\nsorimotor-based intersubjective resonance, which produces a low-level\nunderstanding of the emotional states of others (Keysers & Gazzola,\n2014).\nEmotional contagion is possible, in part, because the physical mo-\ntions involved in expressing emotions, such as smiling, involve motor\nplans. The mechanism producing emotional contagion involves: (1) an\nobserver; (2) a person being observed; and (3) a physical display of\nemotion, typically on one's face, by the person being observed. Once the\nobserved person facially displays an emotional response, the observer\nsubconsciously accesses their motor plan for the emotional display,\nwhich activates parts of the brain that generate the emotions associated\nwith the observed facial expression (Niedenthal, Mermillod, Maringer,\n& Hess, 2010;A .Wood, Rychlowska, Korb, & Niedenthal, 2016).

One powerful ex-\nample of this form of learning relates to racism. Based upon the me-\nchanisms involved in vicarious classical conditioning, it is possible for a\nchild to associate speci\ufb01c racial groups with negative emotions by\nmerely observing the negative facial expressions of others, such as\nprimary groups members (Conger, Dygdon, & Rollock, 2012). Thus,\ninsofar as emotions serve as a basis of motivation, the emotional states\nresulting from vicarious classical conditioning can serve asunconscious\nmotivations for crime (e.g., the use of racial epitaphs or commission of\nhate crimes) within the retro\ufb01tted social learning theory (see, e.g.,\nTalaska, Fiske, & Chaiken, 2008).\nPsychological research has also identi\ufb01ed the types of people that\nare most likely to in\ufb02uence a person when vicarious operant con-\nditioning is occurring (for a review, seeDebiec & Olsson, 2017). Re-\nsearch shows that an individual's perceived degree of relatedness and\nsimilarity to, as well as familiarity with, an observed other signi\ufb01cantly\nin\ufb02uences the degree to which vicariously classical conditioning occurs.\nLikewise, research has shown that perceived social dominance and level\nof attributed skill a\ufb00ect the degree to which vicarious classical con-\nditioning occurs. Further, the degree to which individuals empathize\nwith observed others also a\ufb00ects vicarious classical conditioning.\nTaken together, the inclusion of vicarious classical conditioning\nwithin the retro\ufb01t model of social learning theory provides numerous\nnew opportunities to explore how emotions and emotional contagion\nmight in\ufb02uence criminal motivation. Additionally, since emotions can\nin\ufb02uence operant conditioning insofar as they relate to the goals one is\npursuing (e.g., the alleviation of fear or releasing frustration), the\nphenomenon of vicarious classical conditioning might also help to ex-\nplain skill formation in regard to speci\ufb01c crimes.\n5.2.3. Semantic memory\nSocial learning theory (Akers, 2009) states that individuals learn\nde\ufb01nitions through operant conditioning. Depending on the kind of\nde\ufb01nition, however, this is not physiologically possible. Attitudes and\nneutralizations are forms of semantic knowledge that cannot be learned\nthrough operant conditioning. Instead, semantic memory in\ufb02uences the\nmechanism of operant conditioning insofar as a person's attitudes or\nneutralizations a\ufb00ect the action plan one generates (Borghesani et al.,\n2016; Kal\u00e9nine & Buxbaum, 2016; Quandt, Lee, & Chatterjee, 2017).\nFurther, semantic memory also in\ufb02uences the mechanism of vicarious\noperant conditioning insofar as an individual's attitudes or neutraliza-\ntions a\ufb00ect one's symbolic de\ufb01 nitions or interpretations of others\n(Golkar, Castro, & Olsson, 2015; Golkar & Olsson, 2017 ) and their ob-\nserved actions (Gerson, Meyer, Hunnius, & Bekkering, 2017; Hudson,\nNicholson, Ellis, & Bach, 2016; Joiner, Piva, Turrin, & Chang, 2017;\nYang, Rosenblau, Keifer, & Pelphrey, 2015).\nLikewise, social learning theory's concept of motives is also mis-\nspeci\ufb01ed.

Instead, their salience in a\ngiven situation in\ufb02uences the formation of an action plan within op-\nerant conditioning but are not themselves a product of operant con-\nditioning.\nIn regard to criticisms that social learning theory arti\ufb01cial con\ufb02ates\nreinforcements and anticipated reinforcements, the phenomenon of\nsemantic memory can be used to partially resolve this criticism in the\nretro\ufb01t model. Since the product of operant conditioning, a motor plan,\nis not consciously accessible knowledge, it is not physiologically pos-\nsible for operant conditioning to produce consciously accessible\nknowledge of causes and e\ufb00ects. Insofar as an individual possess such\nknowledge, and it is consciously accessible and abstract, then such\nknowledge must be stored within semantic memory as a schema\u2014 or,\nmore speci\ufb01cally, a script (see, e.g.,Schank & Abelson, 1977)\u2014 which\nspeci\ufb01es how a typical event should unfold. Should an individual pos-\nsess such a script, it was either learned through symbolic communica-\ntion or the generalization of episodic memories into an abstract script,\nnot through operant conditioning.\n5.2.4. Episodic memory\nSocial learning theory ( Akers, 2009) does not include episodic\nmemory in its explanation of crime, although this form of memory can\nbe partially related to social learning theory's concept of anticipated\nreinforcements, as was the case with semantic memory in the previous\nsection. Social learning theory contends an outcome of operant con-\nditioning is that a person learns which behaviors are reinforced by a\nspeci\ufb01c stimulus. Consequently, in future situations, a person chooses\nto engage in the behavior that one anticipates will be reinforced based\nupon the previously discussed matching function. Since operant con-\nditioning is not physiologically capable of generating consciously ac-\ncessible memories, however, memories of a speci\ufb01c event are learned in\nparallel to operant conditioning through encoding, storage, and re-\ntrieval and are stored as episodic memories. Thus, it is possible for\nanticipated reinforcements to be episodic memories that can be con-\nsciously accessed and used when formulating action plans as part of\noperant conditioning.\n5.2.5. Autobiographical memory\nAutobiographical memory, like other forms of declarative memory,\nis not explicitly present within social learning theory. Certain concepts\nwithin social learning, however, suggest the presence of auto-\nbiographical memory in its explanation of crime. With neutralization\ntheory, for example,Sykes and Matza (1957)note that one function of\nneutralizations is to allow delinquents to preserve their self-images as\nconformists even though they are, in fact, deviants. The idea that a\ndelinquent has a self-image necessitates the presence of a form of\nmemory where such a self-image is stored. Likewise, within social\nlearning theory, a person forms a de\ufb01nition of self that plays a role in\nself-regulation. According toAkers (2009), self-regulation occurs when\nan individual punishes him- or herself or anticipates the reinforcements\nothers might apply regarding a speci\ufb01c act. By combining this concept\nwith that of anticipated reinforcement, it is possible for an individual to\nanticipate a self-imposed reinforcement relating to a speci\ufb01c act. Con-\nsequently, this obscure component of social learning theory implies that\nanticipated self-reinforcement could be of etiological signi\ufb01cance.\nIn the retro\ufb01t model of social learning theory, this has several im-\nplications. First, as operant conditioning relates solely to skills, social\nlearning theory's mechanism of self-regulation is physiologically not\npossible in at least two ways.

If a person had felt bad in the past after\nengaging in an act, the emotion experienced would be attached to the\nautobiographical episodic memory and could function as an auto-\nbiographical-episodic form of reinforcement. A second way is that the\nautobiographical memory might contain abstract knowledge of one's\nself that holds the person is not the kind of person who engages in\ncriminal behavior. Thus, the person would not refrain out of fear of\npunishment, but instead out of the abstract sense the behavior is in-\nconsistent with\u2018who they are\u2019and the individual would not feel\u2018right\u2019\nabout it.

The matching function\nBased on the retro\ufb01t model, the matching function no longer pro-\nvides an adequate explanation as to why individuals engage in crime\nwithin a particular situation. Since the matching function is a vestigial\nelement of the previous version of social learning theory, which is en-\ncumbered by its behaviorist origins, the matching function serves as a\nplaceholder in the retro\ufb01t model until a suitable replacement can be\nidenti\ufb01ed. While this is beyond the scope of this paper, a suitable re-\nplacement for the matching will likely depend on mechanisms related\nto theory of mind that allow individuals to engage in mental simula-\ntions to arrive at courses of action (see Proctor & Niemeyer, 2019:\nChapter 14).\n6. Methodological implications\nThe retro\ufb01t model of social learning theory has several methodo-\nlogical implications depending on the form of memory being empiri-\ncally examined. As nondeclarative forms of memory are not consciously\naccessible to individuals, traditional survey methods employed by\ncriminologists cannot directly observe the content stored within non-\ndeclarative memory. Declarative memory, however, is highly amenable\nto being investigated through survey methods. In the following sec-\ntions, we further elaborate on how each form of memory can be em-\npirically examined. As an exhaustive review of the applicable cognitive\npsychological and neuroscienti\ufb01c methods is beyond the scope of this\npaper due to space constraints, we limit our discussion of methods from\nthese\ufb01elds to a handful of methods that directly pertain to the retro\ufb01t\nmodel of social learning theory.\n6.1. Actions and habits\nWithin the retro\ufb01t model of social learning theory, actions can be\nlearned through several distinct mechanistic pathways: (1) operant\nconditioning; (2) vicarious operant conditioning; and (3) observational\nlearning. As previously discussed, verbal instructions can in\ufb02uence\noperant learning by populating the internal model present within an\naction plan with semantic knowledge regarding expected outcomes for\na given act and the speci\ufb01c actions associated with producing the de-\nsired outcome. These properties of actions, as well as their non-\ndeclarative nature, have several empirical and methodological im-\nplications for the retro\ufb01t model.\nFirst, the three mechanisms involved in learning skills\u2014 operant\nconditioning, vicarious operant conditioning, and observational lear-\nning\u2014 should progressively accelerate the learning process, with op-\nerant conditioning alone being the slowest means of acquiring a new\nskill, vicarious reinforcement producing more rapid learning because of\nthe presence of a model, and observational learning being the fastest\nmeans of acquiring new skills because it involves tutoring by the be-\nhavioral model (Ruge et al., 2018).\nSecond, insofar as interview or survey methods involving re-\nspondent self-reporting are being employed to measure these three\nforms of learning, it is important to note that all such methods only\nindirectly measure operant conditioning mechanisms and the skills they\nproduce. This is because the product of operant conditioning is a skill\nthat is stored in memory as a motor plan that is not consciously ac-\ncessible to an actor. Since, however, episodic and autobiographical\nmemories can form in parallel with operant conditioning (Dunsmoor &\nKroes, 2019; Raber et al., 2019), survey methods are capable of mea-\nsuring episodic or autobiographical memories that are formed si-\nmultaneously when one is learning through operant conditioning. Thus,\nit is possible to ask respondents how they learned a crime-speci\ufb01c skill\neven if this only indirectly measures the precise operant conditioning\nmechanism through which the skill was learned.\nSurvey instruments can, therefore, be designed toindirectly measure\nthe form of operant conditioning that was operating when a person\nlearned a criminal skill. Should a skill be learned through operant\nconditioning, survey questions should identify whether a person was\nexposed\nto a behavioral model when learning the skill to di\ufb00erentiate\nbetween operant and vicarious operant conditioning mechanisms.\nLikewise, if the respondent has been exposed to a model, questions\nshould measure whether the behavioral modeling occurred in a passive\nor active manner.Figs.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4382, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c04a8a2-558e-4f93-a37c-5e700e79bbe4": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c04a8a2-558e-4f93-a37c-5e700e79bbe4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee4107bb-e812-426e-943f-3051e24fc105", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "71559942ddae816a524b88f02b4d095eb770ed4a7437e478dc0610e6bc9d080f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "16150b4b-b514-47f0-a0b1-7566fdd7a7c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "941328633a04d5f1f15ff8b09dccb8c638f5844d387444543c69914d90ad7903", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Thus,\nit is possible to ask respondents how they learned a crime-speci\ufb01c skill\neven if this only indirectly measures the precise operant conditioning\nmechanism through which the skill was learned.\nSurvey instruments can, therefore, be designed toindirectly measure\nthe form of operant conditioning that was operating when a person\nlearned a criminal skill.

Consequently, such cases are prone to inference errors (De\nNeys, Schaeken, & D'Ydewalle, 2003 ; Dickstein, 1980; Oaksford &\nChater, 2010). Thus, e\ufb00orts to indirectly measure operant conditioning\nmechanisms utilizing episodic memory are subject to forms of mea-\nsurement error that are unique to the form of declarative memory being\nused by a respondent when answering survey questions.\nThird, criminologists could also employ experimental methods to\ndetermine how one's experiences with di\ufb00erent forms of operant con-\nditioning a\ufb00ect how long it takes for an individual to acquire a given\ncriminal skill, as well as one's pro\ufb01ciency with it. For example, the\ndi\ufb00erent forms of operant conditioning measured in the survey instru-\nment presented inFigs. 3\u20135 could serve as the basis for di\ufb00erent groups\nto which a person could be randomly assigned within an experiment in\nregard to the same task (e.g., hotwiring a car). Traditional ANOVA or\nANCOVA analysis could be conducted to determining if speci\ufb01c forms\nof learning produce the faster acquisition of a skill or higher levels of\npro\ufb01ciency.\nFourth, criminologists could directly measure if, how, and when\nverbal instructions a\ufb00ect operant learning of criminal and deviant be-\nhavior by either adopting the same research methodologies employed\nby cognitive neuroscientists and psychologists when investigating si-\nmilar research questions or by integrating the results of these studies as\nan indirect crucial test. For example, within the\ufb01elds of psychology\nand cognitive neuroscience, human learning that occurs vis-\u00e0-vis in-\nstructions, instead of by direct experience, is called either instruction-\nbased learning (IBL) or rapid instructed task learning (RITL) (Ruge,\nSch\u00e4fer, Zwosta, Mohr, & Wolfensteller, 2019). Although contemporary\nempirical research on IBL/RITL is still emerging (Liefooghe, Braem, &\nMeiran,\n2018), there is already a general consensus within the litera-\nture that several brain regions underlying working memory play a\ncritical role in the process (Cole, Laurent, & Stocco, 2013; Liefooghe\net al., 2018; Ruge et al., 2019).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3646, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65436c20-273a-4808-874d-6e43a3a8cd45": {"__data__": {"id_": "65436c20-273a-4808-874d-6e43a3a8cd45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8b4a28e6-7810-4a9f-9699-78071e55c301", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "fea4c243d7453538b86c2c728ff69e09a1323ae1011b48d3c9587d973ae7a1fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b97d95c5-c770-4675-ad36-0c12884549aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "e37149cf4b1b36c9719e5ec58b7008dfd560e9fb3becf4b21aee7897e43354b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3f14873-c855-41df-8960-e3db6697b71e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd7a89cd522b2317c247acecd443f3cdda7cebd74920f6a8fd2882a979b7642a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For example, within the\ufb01elds of psychology\nand cognitive neuroscience, human learning that occurs vis-\u00e0-vis in-\nstructions, instead of by direct experience, is called either instruction-\nbased learning (IBL) or rapid instructed task learning (RITL) (Ruge,\nSch\u00e4fer, Zwosta, Mohr, & Wolfensteller, 2019).

Speci\ufb01cally, the empirical evidence\nsuggests that a subset of brain regions within the working memory\nsystem are responsible for maintaining the instructed stimulus-response\nassociations in mind (e.g., press the return key, the response, when the\nword \u2018co\ufb00ee\u2019is displayed), while other brain regions are responsible for\nactivating already-learned responses and organizing them into the se-\nquence indicated by the instructions (Cole, Bagic, Kass, & Schneider,\n2010; Meiran, Liefooghe, & De Houwer, 2017;Pereg & Meiran, 2019).\nConsequently, given the neurological division of labor, it is possible for\ncriminologists to use fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)\nand other neuroimaging technologies to not only map how instructions\nto commit criminal behavior activate and organize previously learned\nskills and declarative knowledge as required by the criminal task, but\nalso how the neurological mechanism di\ufb00ers from direct learning (see,\ne.g., Koban, Jepma, L\u00f3pez-Sol\u00e0, & Wager, 2019).\nLastly, based upon these implications, criminologists could arrive at\na variety of indirect and direct measures of learning mechanisms for\nempirical tests of the retro\ufb01t model that allow for the triangulation of\nresults. In doing so, they could better address claims that social learning\ntheory lacks empirical support for its claims and that concepts are not\nsu\ufb03ciently di\ufb00erentiated from those in rival theories.\n6.2.

At its fullest ex-\npression, the startle response is \u201ca whole-body \ufb02exor reaction to\nsudden, intense, stimulation whose function is defensive in nature,\ndesigned to protect the organism from assault by closing the eyes,\nducking the head, and pulling in the limbs\u201d (Bradley & Sabatinelli,\n2003:65)\u2014 for example, imagine how an individual would react if a\nloud gunshot unexpectedly went o\ufb00 right next to them. However, even\nsubtler stimuli, such as when individuals are exposed to persons of\ncolor, can still generate an observable behavioral response, such as the\neyeblink re\ufb02ex (Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1990)\u2014 which is an in-\nvoluntary blinking of the eyelids due to the contraction of the orbicu-\nlaris oculi muscle that surrounds the eye (Blumenthal et al., 2005;\nBradley & Sabatinelli, 2003; Sterling, 2013). The magnitude of the\neyeblink re\ufb02ex is easily measured by placing two electromyographic\n(EMG) recording electrodes on the surface of the skin above orbicularis\noculi muscle to record the level of electrical activity occurring within\nthe muscle (Bradley & Sabatinelli, 2003). This and other measures of\neyeblink response have been correlated with the presence or degree of\nracial bias, such that the greater the magnitude and amplitude of the\nrecorded electrical signal, the stronger the eyeblink re\ufb02ex; and the\nstronger the eyeblink re\ufb02ex, the larger the detected implicit racial bias\nusing other established indicators (March & Graham, 2014).\nAnother way to operationalize implicit racial biases is to use eye-\ntracking software to measure changes in individuals' pupil dilation in\nresponse to being exposed to racial other (see, e.g., Wu, Laeng, &\nMagnussen, 2012). Like the aperture of a camera, pupils alter their size\nto a\ufb00ect the amount of light entering the eye to alter\u201cthe amount of\nvisual information that the brain receives, thus increasing visual sen-\nsitivity; therefore, a dilated pupil, compared to a constricted pupil, al-\nlows you to better detect faint stimuli\u201d (Math\u00f4t, 2018:9). Although\npupil size is automatically controlled by the pupillary light re\ufb02ex in\nresponse to changes in light intensity, pupils will also automatically\ndilate when individuals experience an arousing stimulus, thought, or\nemotion as a part of the\u2018\ufb02ight-or-\ufb01ght\u2019response (Math\u00f4t, 2018). For\nthis reason, a change in pupil dilation when viewing persons of color is\nbelieved to be an indirect measure of arousal-level due to threat-based\nstereotypes (Chekroud, Everett, Bridge, & Hewstone, 2014; Fleming,\nBandy, & Kimble, 2010) or other biases (Goldinger, He, & Papesh,\n2009).\nStill\nanother way to measure the e\ufb00ects of classical conditioning on\nimplicit racial bias is to use neuroimaging technology to detect changes\nin neural activity in the parts of the brain that initiate and coordinate\nthe various defensive responses associated with the startle re \ufb02ex\n(Lonsdorf et al., 2017; Molapour, Golkar, Navarrete, Haaker, & Olsson,\n2015). Furthermore, it is worth noting here that emerging research\ndemonstrates that it is possible to use fMRI to distinguish between vi-\ncarious and direct classical conditioning of implicit racial bias based on\nslight di\ufb00erences in the brain regions involved in the generative me-\nchanism underlying the experience ( Lindstr\u00f6m, Haaker, & Olsson,\n2018).\n6.3.

Episodic, semantic, and autobiographical memory\nAlong with their theoretical implications, integrating semantic,\nepisodic, and autobiographical memory into the retro \ufb01tted social\nlearning theory has clear implications for how the theory is tested. First,\nthe fact that all three forms of declarative memory can be deliberately\nrecalled means criminologists can measure how semantic, episodic, and\nautobiographical learning and knowledge in\ufb02uence criminal motiva-\ntions through traditional interviews and surveys (see, e.g., Levine,\nSvoboda, Hay, Winocur, & Moscovitch, 2002). Second, criminologists\ncan use neural imaging technologies, such as fMRI and EEG (electro-\nencephalogram), to observe neural activity in the regions of the brain\nthat generate and recall all three forms of declarative memory when\nengaging in criminal or deviant behavior, or di\ufb00er between noncriminal\nand criminal motivations, behaviors, and contexts (see, e.g.,\nMoscovitch, Nadel, Winocur, Gilboa, & Rosenbaum, 2006).\nKey di\ufb00erences in how episodic, semantic, and autobiographical\nmemory are each constituted, stored, and recalled in the brain ne-\ncessitates corresponding adjustments in how each form of memory is\nmeasured. In short, because episodic memory is comprised of personal\nexperiences from a \ufb01rst-person perspective, survey and interview\nquestions should be speci\ufb01cally worded to take these aspects of episodic\nmemory into account. Likewise, because semantic memory is devoid of\nsituational knowledge and a \ufb01rst-person perspective, survey and in-\nterview questions targeting semantic memory should not include these\nfeatures. Further, given that autobiographical memory characterizes\nboth episodic and general knowledge about oneself and one's experi-\nences, survey and interview questions should be explicitly constructed\nto probe these di\ufb00erent forms of content.\nAltering how a question or verbal task is stated in order to capture\ndi\ufb00erent forms of learning and memory is a well-established procedure\nin psychology and cognitive neuroscience (see, e.g.,Palombo, Williams,\nAbdi, & Levine, 2013), and the practice can be easily adopted by\ncriminologists. For example, questions designed to measure episodic,\nsemantic, and autobiographical memories that might be related to\ncriminal behavior are presented inFig. 6. Within the\ufb01gure, Questions\n1\u20133 are designed to examine one's episodic memories relating to the last\ntime the respondent did something he or she believed to be wrong, and\nthe respondent's parents knew about the act. These questions are de-\nsigned to take the respondent back to the time when the act was\ncommitted and report how his or her parents emotionally reacted to the\nInstructions: For the next several questions, I would like you to \nthink about the last thing you did that you think is morally \nwrong.\n1.

Question 4 is designed to measure the respondent's\ngeneral stereotype or schema of how his or her parents typically emo-\ntionally respond when the respondent engages in immoral activities.\nThus, Question 4, being devoid of speci\ufb01c situational information, is a\nmeasure of semantic memory.\nLastly, Questions 5 and 6 are designed to measure one's auto-\nbiographical memories in relation to his or her immoral behavior.\nQuestion 5 serves a measure of an autobiographical episodic memory\nbecause it asks how he or she felt within a speci\ufb01c situation, while\nQuestion 6 serves as a measure of an autobiographical semantic\nmemory because it asks how the respondent generally feels after com-\nmitting an immoral act.\nIntegrating semantic, episodic, and autobiographical memory into\nthe retro\ufb01tted social learning theory further enables criminologists to\ntake into account the role false memories and other memory errors play\nin the etiology of crime or in interview or survey research methodol-\nogies. Declarative memory is unique to the degree that individual\nmemories can be deliberately recalled, consciously decomposed, and\n\ufb02exibly recombined to infer novel situations or outcomes (Carpenter &\nSchacter, 2018a; Schwabe, Nader, & Pruessner, 2014). However, ac-\ncording to extensive research in both psychology and cognitive neu-\nroscience, the same physical properties of the brain that give declara-\ntive memory these characteristics also make them susceptible to\ndistortion. This is because the various associations constituting the\noriginal memory are temporarily\u201cloosened\u201d during recall so that they\nmay be decomposed or recombined, and thus are temporarily vulner-\nable to the inclusion of error or other distortions as they reconsolidate\nafter recall (Kensinger & Ford, 2019 ; Scully, Napper, & Hupbach,\n2017)\u2014 although there remains some disagreement in the literature\nregarding the exact mechanism underlying this e\ufb00ect (for a review, see\nLee, Nader, and Schiller (2017).\nJust as survey questions might contain memory and inference errors\nwhen indirectly measuring skills, survey questions measuring in-\nformation stored within declarative memory are also prone to mea-\nsurement error because of the very nature of declarative memory. One\nexample of such a possibility is related to concerns that survey re-\nspondents project their own criminal behavior onto their peers when\nasked to report their peers' levels of deviant or criminal behavior (for\nreviews, see Hoeben, Meldrum, Walker, & Young, 2016; Pratt et al.,\n2010). Recently, criminologists examining this projection bias have\nrelied on the use of structural equation modeling techniques applied to\nsurvey data to observe the presence of this projection bias (see, e.g.,\nRebellon & Modecki, 2014; Young, Rebellon, Barnes, & Weerman,\n2014; Young & Weerman, 2014).\nBased on the retro\ufb01t model of social learning, new methods become\navailable to examine the precise mechanisms involved in projection and\nfurther illuminate this black box in a manner that is internally con-\nsistent with the retro\ufb01t model. For example, research on source mem-\nory\u2014 the ability to recall when and where something was learned, from\nwhom, and through which sensory modality ( Mitchell & Johnson,\n2009)\u2014 has demonstrated that a combination of carefully designed\nprobing questions and neuroimaging technology can not only disen-\ntangle a memory's source, but also the degree to which the memory\nre\ufb02ects a true event or a false memory/memory error (Abe et al., 2008;\nMitchell & Johnson, 2009; Stark, Okado, & Loftus, 2010 ; Volz, Stark,\nVaitl, & Ambach, 2019).\nAs noted byHoeben et al.

Should\nthis question be asked within the context of a study that combines the\nuse of survey questions with fMRI observations of brain regions, the\nfMRI could possibly reveal if parts of the brain associated with the re-\ncall of episodic, semantic, or autobiographical memories were active\nduring the answering of the question.

Although speculative, the retro\ufb01t model of social learning\ntheory, combined with established protocols in psychology and cogni-\ntive neuroscience, enables criminologists to examine these possible\nmechanisms in a way that would not be possible using the traditional\nsocial learning theory framework.\nTable 1contains a summary of the various forms of nondeclarative\nand declarative memories and the research methodologies and tech-\nnologies that can be used to investigate their etiological role in criminal\nbehavior. While the research methodological and technologies listed\nare by no means exhaustive, they do provide criminologists with a\nstarting point as to how components within the retro\ufb01t model of social\nlearning theory might be empirically examined.\n7. Conclusion\nOver the last two decades, renewed criticisms of social learning\ntheory have focused on the theory's lack of empirical support, failure to\nadequately di\ufb00erentiate between concepts, and inability to explain how\nverbal cues operate within its behaviorist paradigm. To address these\nissues, a retro\ufb01t statement of social learning theory was proposed that\nupdates the theory with contemporary understandings of learning and\nmemory that have been produced within cognitive psychology and\nneuroscience.\nThe retro\ufb01t model of social learning theory corrects several pro-\nblems inherent to the theory. First, it addresses criticisms that hold little\nis actually known about how crime is learned. Unconstrained by the\nbehaviorist paradigm, the retro \ufb01t model speci\ufb01es various ways in\nwhich skills, conditioned behaviors, episodic memories, semantic\nmemories, and autobiographical memories all can in\ufb02uence criminal\nbehavior and motivation. Second, the retro\ufb01t model allows for clear\ndistinctions to be made between di \ufb00erent forms of learning and\nmemory in a way not possible within the previous statement of social\nlearning theory, which omitted the concept of memory altogether. More\nimportantly, the forms of memory and learning present within the\nretro\ufb01t model are not merely analytical constructs. Instead, they are\nconcrete phenomena that can be di\ufb00erentiated in terms of their neu-\nroanatomical and neurophysiological properties \u2014 that is, they are\nphysiologically distinct. Third, the retro\ufb01t model corrects several errors\npresent within social learning theory. As a form of learning, operant\nconditioning, for example, is only capable of producing motor plans\n(i.e., skills), not the forms of symbolic meanings typically attribute to\nthe theory's concept of de\ufb01nitions. Likewise, in the retro\ufb01t model, vi-\ncarious reinforcement is a special case of operant conditioning, not an\naltogether di\ufb00erent form of learning.\nFourth, an additional consequence of addressing these issues within\nsocial learning theory is that the concept ofde\ufb01nitions within it becomes\nsynonymous with the phenomena of learning and memory. As a result,\nthe retro\ufb01t model facilitates new lines of research within the social\nlearning theory framework. For example, the retro\ufb01t model introduces\nthe concept of vicarious classical conditioning into the theory, which\ncould provide numerous insights into di\ufb00erent ways through which\ncriminal motivations might be acquired in regard to emotions.\nAdditionally, the retro\ufb01t model's incorporation of semantic memory\nallows for numerous insights related to the formation and properties of\nschemas to be readily integrated into social learning theory. Lastly, the\npresence of autobiographical memory within the retro\ufb01t model allows\ncriminologists to begin directly incorporating social psychological\ntheories of identity and the self with the social learning framework.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4565, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bcb26ac-87a0-43a4-ac68-323926d29364": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bcb26ac-87a0-43a4-ac68-323926d29364", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32e824d6-139d-47d5-9bfd-97be09583637", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "b92e37c625741909f789517e3f761997e4b7812a97f94bb3fb542b388c590eaa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "78041c71-be0b-4b3e-a648-fbfd17716cf0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/j.jcrimjus.2019.101655.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1181829, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "6c54a207037120de8b61aacd2b8c9029dec3bbf806a89e7c45f1f9c3a114b12b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c147a9e-09a3-41cd-acfe-31a1d7a269e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0242e9695f5ae145ca8589faa9d6b55646b998712c7fbf10a0cadc5295e717b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Fourth, an additional consequence of addressing these issues within\nsocial learning theory is that the concept ofde\ufb01nitions within it becomes\nsynonymous with the phenomena of learning and memory.

Lastly, the\npresence of autobiographical memory within the retro\ufb01t model allows\ncriminologists to begin directly incorporating social psychological\ntheories of identity and the self with the social learning framework.\nFinally, the retro\ufb01t model of social learning theory introduces\ncriminologists to new research methods and technologies that can be\nemployed when investigating new lines of research, which potentially\ncan lead to rapid scienti\ufb01c discovery in regard to social learning theory.\nAs noted byCollins (1994), the social sciences have historically lacked\nthe introduction of new research methodologies and technologies that\nallow for the observation of new phenomena or the ability to\u2018tinker\u2019\nwith research technologies in ways that allow for new forms of theo-\nrizing and empirical observation. Collins notes these\u2018tinkerable\u2019forms\nresearch methodologies (e.g., combining a telescope with a prism to\nallow for the interstellar observation of di\ufb00erent wavelengths of light)\nallow new phenomena to be observed and theorized about, which leads\nto scienti\ufb01c progress. Tinkerable research technologies are di\ufb00erent\nfrom advances in other forms of research methodologies (e.g., statistical\nanalysis) that rely on human insights or manipulation of existing data\n(e.g., survey data) to generate insights in that they allow for the gen-\nuine observation of new phenomena that serve as the objects of scien-\nti\ufb01c inquiry.\nIn recent years, criminologists have increasingly argued for the\nimportation of research methods and technologies from neighboring\nscienti\ufb01c \ufb01elds to allow for more rapid scienti \ufb01c developments in\ncriminology (see, e.g., Proctor & Niemeyer, 2019;Wright & Boisvert,\n2009; Wright & Cullen, 2012). The research methods and technologies\npresented within this paper in regard to the retro\ufb01t model of social\nlearning theory take an important step in this regard, as they allow\ncriminologists to directly observe new phenomena of direct importance\nto social learning theory that have traditionally remained outside of the\npurview of the theory, as well as triangulate new methodologies with\ntraditional ones.\nReferences\nAbe, N., Okuda, J., Suzuki, M., Sasaki, H., Matsuda, T., Mori, E., ...

Instead, most students utilize ineffective \nmethods such as rereading and highlighting. After discussing the \nresearch on effective and ineffective study techniques, the paper focuses \non \nmy attempts to help students change their study skills by providing \nthem with optional reading material, developing an assignment that \ndraws on the research, or requiring them to utilize the techniques on \nan exam. Based on my experiences, it appears that requiring students to \nutilize \nthe study techniques in order to earn points resulted in greater \nadoption of scientifically-based study techniques than informing the \nstudents \nabout the benefits of t he scienti fically-based techniques.

My strategy was to reread every assigned reading, which I had \ndiligently highlighted so that nearly every word was pink, yello w, or blue. \nI also would highlight and reread my class notes. Finall y, I would make \nflashcards for every vocabulary word in the textbook, including terms \nthat were never mentioned in class. I would skim study guide questions, \nbut I was spending so much time rereading and memorizing the book \u2019s \nbolded terms that I usually did not write out answ ers to the study guide \nquestions\u2014after all, if I knew everything in the book, I could answer \nanything on a test!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1914, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a55fd4f4-81b4-43f3-8bed-dbbd0d38820a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a55fd4f4-81b4-43f3-8bed-dbbd0d38820a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 320743, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c833d5cc-6a21-466d-b6d0-cc9b10252f77", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 320743, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "80296f3f9f4d7e3dab0c50b342fe1a75085e768dff62e04317f8068e9f19cdde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "45                  No. 30 \u2013 2017\n Where had I learned this interesting set of study techniques? \nLearning how to study was not something I was ever taught to do by my \nteachers. Instead, my college studying plan was based on my intuition \nabout how to learn, which is how most students develop a studying plan. \nBasing study techniques on intuition results in college students spending \na substantial portion of their valuable study time rereading the textbook, \nnotes, and study guide answers (Karpicke, Butler, & Roediger, 2010). It \nmakes sense that if students want to learn something then they should \nkeep rereading the information because then it will be stored in their \nmemory. Unfortunately, as I will explain later, basing study techniques on \nthese intuitive explanations of how learning works results in a reliance on \nineffective study techniques that actually make it hard to learn. \n Once students have developed their study strategies, they may use \ntheir test scores as an indicator of the effectiveness of the technique. Students \nwho receive high grades on exams may incorrectly assume that the reason \nfor the high grade was the specific way they studied. What students forget \nis that personal experience is a weak form of evidence. When I studied for \na test using my study method, I was unable to compare my performance \non that test to my performance had I used different study strategies. Each \ntime I received a B+ on an exam, I had no way of knowing that if I had \nsimply focused on retrieval practice techniques I might have received an A. \nInstead, I would think that if I had not used my \u201csystem,\u201d then I would have \nreceived a much lower grade. Relying on personal experience also means \nstudents are unable to rule out alternative explanations for their exam \nscores, such as the exam material focused on material they had previously \nlearned, not the study technique used. Relying on personal experience can \nalso cause students who receive low exam scores to blame the teacher, exam \nformat, or their own lack of ability rather than their poor study techniques. \nStudents may even end up deciding they have \u201ctest anxiety\u201d or that they \nare \u201cbad at taking tests,\u201d both of which can be terminal self-diagnoses that \ncause students to give up.\n The lack of formal study skills instruction in the K-12 system as \nwell as in higher education is surprising because teaching students how \nto learn effectively and efficiently is one of the top priorities of educators.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2497, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "add925bf-14ea-4968-a9ec-b2b88214b7e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "add925bf-14ea-4968-a9ec-b2b88214b7e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 320743, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5a73f01e-5128-447a-ac8d-0c025b01048b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 320743, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "5b6ef2d18842a1cb4d18cd29b674ba9ad9a6583eb9c14a2f22c14bd435bba8c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Headwaters      A CSB/SJU Faculty Journal 46\nUsually the teacher\u2019s instructions are simply to \u201cstudy for the test.\u201d This \nsuggestion is often paired with a cautionary tale about what happens to the \nstudent who only studies for an hour or two for the exam. Thus students \nmay get the message that the amount of time is what matters, not the \nstudy techniques being employed. Additionally, students are often told \nthat people have different learning styles, which contributes to students \nand teachers believing that each student needs to figure out how they best \nlearn.

I then will share my attempts to \nteach students how to study and the results of my efforts.\nEffective and Ineffective Study T echniques\nContrary to what many people believe, it is possible to identify effective \nand ineffective study techniques by conducting experiments (e.g., Bjork, \nDunlosky, & Cornell, 2013; Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel, 2014). For \nexample, in one experiment students were told they were going to be tested \non a passage from a textbook (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). After all of \nthe students read the passage, some of the students were allowed to reread \nthe passage until they had read it four times. Others read the passage once \nand then they had to write down everything they could remember about \nthe passage (without ever looking at the textbook again). Both groups were \nthen asked to predict how much they had learned. The students who were \nallowed to read the article four times thought they had learned more than \nthe students who read the article once and then wrote what they could \nremember from the article. One week later they were tested on the passage. \nThe results of the test showed that participants who got to reread the article \nactually scored much lower on the test than the participants who only read", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2448, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e4fee17-2011-4d2a-85a2-bc39cccb0220": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e4fee17-2011-4d2a-85a2-bc39cccb0220", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 320743, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4462a1b1-766d-4aab-ba50-02b8e4b1ce36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/EffectiveStudying.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 320743, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "af508b2a6272cd394bf58bab643e3d336fb18774f1b2d78eaad649ac67ff4df4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "47                  No. 30 \u2013 2017\nthe passage once and then wrote about what they remembered from the \npassage without consulting the passage again. The results of studies such \nas the one by Roediger and Karpicke (2006a) may surprise people whose \nbeliefs about learning are based on intuition (including the participants \nin the study, who were unable to predict how well they had learned the \nmaterial). When examining the results of decades of research, there is strong \nempirical evidence that rereading and highlighting are both ineffective \nways to learn material (e.g., Brown et al., 2014; Callender & McDaniel, \n2009; Dunlosky, Rawson, Marsh, Nathan, & Willingham, 2013). Instead, \ntechniques that force the learner to retrieve information from memory, \nsuch as writing down everything you remember, completing practice tests \nfrom memory, and using flashcards, are much more effective (Bjork et al., \n2013; Brown et al., 2014; Roediger & Butler, 2011).   \n Passive techniques such as rereading notes may feel useful because \nwith the help of the notes the student is able to understand the material \nand it feels familiar (Brown et al., 2014). Rereading helps students develop \nthe ability to recognize the material, but does not help them retrieve the \nmaterial from memory (Putnam, Sungkhasettee, & Roediger, 2016). A \nsimilar process may be at work when students copy their notes by hand \nor type up their notes by copying the material verbatim, making it a \npassive technique that does not require much thought (Bjork et al., 2013). \nLearners often assume that if material feels familiar that it is an indication \nthat they have learned the material; however, familiarity is not strongly \nrelated with actual learning, so students may enter an exam thinking they \nhave mastered the material when in fact they are only somewhat familiar \nwith the concepts (Brown et al., 2014; Gilovich, 1991).\n The clear message from cognitive research is that learning takes \neffort (e.g., Bjork, 1994). It is the act of remembering material, making \nconnections between concepts, putting concepts into our own words, \ncreating concrete examples, and asking questions about how and why things \nwork that leads to learning (Putnam et al., 2016). Memory is strengthened \nby waiting until one is on the verge of forgetting and then trying to retrieve \nthe information, which means that it is more effective to space out one\u2019s \nlearning (Carpenter, Cepeda, Rohrer, Kang, & Pashler, 2012).

Another effective \ntechnique is to use elaborative interrogation in which one asks how and why \nthings work and then answers those questions from memory (McDaniel \n& Donnelly, 1996). Engaging in elaborative interrogation helps students \norganize new material, making it easier to recall later on and understand \nthe concepts more thoroughly (Willoughby and Wood, 1994). \n  Creating from memory a concept map that visually organizes \nthe material you are learning and then reviewing what was forgotten or \nincorrect will result in much more learning than looking at a perfectly \ndrawn concept map (Schroeder, Nesbit, Anguiano, & Adesope, 2017). \nRetrieval practice is also the best way to know if you have learned the \nmaterial (e.g., Roediger & Karpicke, 2006b).

When I post study \nguides, I remind students of the scientifically-backed study techniques and \nprovide them with links to the study skills material. Unfortunately, what \ntypically happens was that the students who were already getting A\u2019s might \nglance at some of the resources, whereas the students who could have \nbenefitted the most from a change in their study skills would tell me they \nwere too busy to do additional reading about study skills or to try a new \nstudy technique.

Introductory psychology was the \nperfect class to formally teach students about how to study because the \nmaterial related to topics covered in introductory psychology, students \ntend to struggle on the exams, and many of the students are first years \nand thus may be more open to changing their behavior. In preparation for \nthe lab period when we discussed study techniques, students filled out a \nsurvey describing how they studied and their beliefs about learning. The \nintroductory students reported spending an average of 6 hours studying \nfor exams. Thus, it is not likely that the poor performance on intro exams \nis due solely to lack of effort. Instead, their specific study techniques \nprobably contributed to their difficulties. Students reported that they spent \nabout 75% of their study time rereading their notes, rereading their study \nguides (often referred to by students as \u201cgoing over\u201d their study guide), \nand making vocabulary flashcards. The remaining 25% of their time was \nspent self-testing on material besides vocabulary. Students believed that the \ntechniques they used were effective ways to study for an exam. Students \nacknowledged that cramming for an exam was an ineffective strategy, but \nmany students reported engaging in this practice because they were so busy. \nStudents also acknowledged that there were other retrieval techniques that \nwere effective, but few actually used those techniques.\n At the end of the semester, the introductory psychology lab students \nwere asked the degree to which they had changed their study techniques \nbased upon the scientific research presented in lab regarding effective study \ntechniques. About half of the students reported that they had changed \ntheir techniques, but often times the transformation was rather minor. \nSome students reported that they reduced the amount of time they spent \nrereading their notes, some began using spaced practice, and some reported \nincreased self-testing practices. Unfortunately, many students reported no \nchange in their studying behavior. Some students explained that they had \nalready developed an effective study strategy that worked for them, so they \nhad no reason to change.

The results of the freewrites suggested that even juniors and seniors \nrelied on rereading their notes and study guides, rereading class material, \nand making vocabulary flashcards that encouraged them to mindlessly \nmemorize definitions rather than put the term into their own words. \nThus, nearly every student had the opportunity to develop more effective \ntechniques. \n Students were assigned to read three blog entries from The Learning \nScientists about the three techniques and then come to class ready to commit \nto one of the techniques for exam 1. At the start of the next class period, \nI had the students divide up into study groups of 3-4 students with other \nstudents who were using the same study technique. Students met with \ntheir groups to talk about how they planned to study for the exam using \nthe technique. The groups set up times to meet outside of class to study. \nLater the students turned in individual study plans that required them to \ndraw on the material from the blog site and to create a specific plan leading \nup to the exam. Students then provided feedback to the group members \nregarding their plan, which also was graded. Students had to provide me \nwith \u201ccreative evidence\u201d of their studying, which frequently was a selfie \nof their group studying together, a picture of flashcards asking for real \nworld examples of concepts, colorful concept maps, and other fun ideas. \nFinally, after they took the exam they completed a brief survey and wrote a \nreflection on their study techniques. \n T o further encourage students to try new techniques, I included a \nstudy guide question that required them to make a large concept map that \nincorporated specific experiments, showed connections between concepts, \nand showed how the concepts differed from each other. It was a challenging \ntask for my students. Rather than hoping that the students would spend \ntime working on the concept map while they completed their study guides, \nI had students break into their \u201cstudy groups\u201d and create the concept \nmaps on a whiteboard during class.

Later \nin the semester, I gave them the outline of a concept map that they could \nuse to learn about cognitive dissonance theory for the upcoming exam. \nStudents could print off copies of the concept map so that they could \npractice filling it in from memory.

These \nchanges were possible even with students who had spent years utilizing \nother study techniques. On the other hand, it is sobering to think that \nmany of my students had completed nearly their entire college careers using \nineffective study techniques by the time they took social psychology. Based \non my experience teaching an upper-division content course, I conclude \nthat study skills training can be added to a course without detracting from \nthe main learning goals of the class. Although I was concerned that my \nsocial psychology students may object to using class time to talk about \nsomething other than social psychology, none of the students complained \nthat we were spending time talking about cognitive psychology; instead, \nthey appreciated how much they had learned about social psychology. \n Just as we have decided that it\u2019s important for first year students to \nlearn the foundational skills needed to be college students, such as how to \nwrite, read, discuss, and present, perhaps it is time for us to add learning \nhow to study to our list. Of course, this is one instance in which First Year \nSeminar or the future version of the course would not be the appropriate \nclass to develop study skills. Study skills will be best learned in courses that \nassess learning using in-class exams so that students can develop the skills \nembedded within a course.

The increased \nrigors and pacing of the college classroom and the need to learn material more \nindependently outside of class place greater demands on students\u2019 ability to \nlearn and study effectively (Dresel et al., 2015 ). Unfortunately, in response, \nstudents often increase the amount of time they spend studying without \nnecessarily adapting or improving the specific study approaches they utilize \n(Blasiman et al., 2017 ; Dunlosky et al., 2013 ; Mirghani et al., 2014 ). The \ncognitive psychology literature has clearly established that not all study stra -\ntegies are equally effective (Dunlosky et al., 2013 ). Several researchers have \ndemonstrated that college students often use techniques that are ill-suited for \nmeeting their academic goals (Bartoszewski & Gurung, 2015 ; Gurung, 2005 ; \nGurung et al., 2010 ; Karpicke et al., 2009 ). Others have shown that students \nmay overestimate their learning and its longevity (Bjork et al., 2013 ; Dunlosky \n& Rawson, 2012 ; Garavalia & Gredler, 2002 ; Hacker et al., 2000 ) and that \nstudents are overly confident in the study approaches they use, even when \nCONTACT Tara T.

Together, \nthese shortcomings in students\u2019 knowledge of study approaches and their \nlikelihood of improving performance may undermine students\u2019 academic \nsuccess (Carpenter et al., 2013 ; Dunlosky & Rawson, 2012 ; Hartwig & \nDunlosky, 2012 ; Lerchenfeldt & Nyland, 2016 ; Liew et al., 2015 ).\nThese findings have inspired faculty and researchers to recognize the \nimportance of teaching college students how to study effectively (Dunlosky \net al., 2013 ; Marshak, 1984 ; Pressley et al., 1989 ). Nonetheless, very few studies \nhave empirically investigated whether explicitly teaching students study tips \npositively affects their study habits. One study demonstrated that simply \nencouraging college students to self-reflect about their study approaches \nimproved students\u2019 test scores in an introductory statistics course (Chen \net al., 2017 ). Francisco et al. ( 1998 ) offered a test-taking skills workshop to \nstudents enrolled in a general chemistry course and found that students who \nattended the workshop showed a greater improvement in their examination \nperformance than students who did not. Two more recent studies introduced \n8- to 12-week study skills workshops and documented significant improve -\nments both in students\u2019 self-reported approaches to studying and in exam \nperformance (Mason, 2019 ; Moseki & Schulze, 2010 ). Finally, Biwer et al. \n( 2020 ) compared 21 students who attended three two-hour sessions encoura -\nging awareness, reflection, and practice with study skills to 26 students in \na wait list control group. The sessions improved students\u2019 metacognitive \nknowledge of study skills, particularly helping them to recognize strategies \nthat are not likely to be effective and to instead focus on strategies that lead to \nsignificant gains in learning.\nNot all study skills interventions have been effective, however. For example, \nJairam ( 2020 ) examined the study techniques utilized by 101 students who had \ntaken a first-year seminar focused on study skills. Despite having taken \na course teaching them how to study, many students (35\u201351%) reported \nusing ineffective techniques (e.g., making lists, highlighting) and very few \nstudents (4\u201314%) reported using effective techniques (e.g., creating practice \nquestions, relating new ideas to prior knowledge) later in their collegiate \ncareers. Similarly, Balsh ( 2001 ) gave students a study tips handout. Although \nthey rated the tips as helpful, students reported only utilizing them a moderate \namount in their everyday studying. Finally, Hedin and Kann ( 2019 ) found that \nstudents who completed a three-year-long course with frequent modules in \nstudy skills did not report a significant improvement in their satisfaction with \ntheir study habits or change their study approaches as a result of the three-year \ninvestment in teaching them to study more effectively.\nThus, the literature on the efficacy of directly teaching students to study \nmore effectively is limited in scope, as well as variable in its methods and \nmixed in its outcomes. One relatively simple approach to teaching students \nto study that has documented some success is a \u201cStudy Smarter, Not Harder\u201d \nJOURNAL OF COLLEGE READING AND LEARNING\n 171", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3285, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1bd6aec-f252-4edd-8a3d-250c4a4ab9d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1bd6aec-f252-4edd-8a3d-250c4a4ab9d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "TeachingStudents.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/TeachingStudents.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1150866, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b0e1dd3-fa91-4acb-ae2d-5981c8d913b6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "TeachingStudents.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/TeachingStudents.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1150866, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "a512b6a6c30db34ee46ff20df1e2976ac34796de6594ee794c1beef0820733ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "presentation described by Lineweaver et al. ( 2019 ). This presentation uses \nboth evidence from the cognitive psychology literature as well as active \ndemonstrations to teach students how to study more effectively and effi -\nciently. The presentation only requires an hour of time and can be imple -\nmented in a large group setting, reaching many new college students \nsimultaneously. This contrasts with (but can also be offered in combination \nwith) the more individualized interventions frequently offered by campus \nlearning support centers that generally only target students who are seeking \nacademic assistance. In a past study, Lineweaver et al. ( 2019 ) found that \nstudents who attended the talk perceived the study tips to be more effective \nthan alternate study strategies, reported using the study tips more frequently \nin their coursework than a control group of non-attendees, reported using \nthe recommended strategies one to three years later, and perceived the \nstrategies as having a positive influence on their academic success. Another \npossible approach to teaching students to study more effectively is asking \nthem to read information that outlines recommended study tips (e.g., Balsh, \n2001 ). Putnam et al. ( 2016 ) published an article that promotes many of the \nsame study tips as the \u201cStudy Smarter, Not Harder\u201d presentation and backs \nthem with empirical evidence from the cognitive psychology literature. We \ndesigned the current study to compare the effectiveness of the \u201cStudy \nSmarter, Not Harder\u201d presentation (Lineweaver et al., 2019 ) to the effective -\nness of spending an equivalent amount of time reading the \u201cOptimizing \nLearning in College\u201d article (Putnam et al., 2016 ) for teaching students how \nto study more effectively and efficiently.\nNo studies to date have examined whether Putnam et al.\u2019s ( 2016 ) article is \neffective for helping students improve their studying, and an extensive search \nof the literature did not reveal any past studies comparing the effectiveness of \na presentation approach to asking students to read an article as a method for \nteaching them better study habits. However, past studies have compared how \ncollege students learn in more active, hands-on environments versus more \ndirect delivery, information-intensive learning situations (e.g., traditional lec -\ntures) and have found that active participation in the classroom improves \nlearning and increases student performance (e.g., Deslauriers et al., 2019 , 2011 ; \nDeslauriers & Wieman, 2011 ; Freeman et al., 2014 ). Given that the \u201cStudy \nSmarter, Not Harder\u201d presentation includes hands-on activities and demon -\nstrations, we hypothesized that it would be more effective for teaching students \nstudy tips than the \u201cOptimizing Learning in College\u201d article.\nOur first hypothesis was that students attending the presentation would rate \nthe tips as more effective and helpful and would report using the tips more \noften in their everyday studying than students reading the article. Our second \nhypothesis was that students attending the presentation would better discri -\nminate the effectiveness and helpfulness of the study tips promoted during the \n172\n T. T.

Although the study was \nopen to all students at the university and was advertised widely, many parti -\ncipants were enrolled in a psychology course (100- to 300-level), an introduc -\ntory general chemistry course, or a course designed for first-year exploratory \nmajors due to our direct recruiting of these students. Participants were divided \ninto two groups, those who learned the study tips by attending the \u201cStudy \nSmarter, Not Harder\u201d presentation (presentation group: n = 91) and those \nwho read the \u201cOptimizing Learning in College\u201d article to learn the study tips \n(article group: n = 69). Thirty-eight of these students participated in the \nexperimental portion (the first year) of the study and were randomly assigned \nto the presentation ( n = 20) or article ( n = 18) group. The remaining 122 \nstudents were part of the second portion (the second year) of the study and \nparticipated as a convenience sample of presentation attendees who later \ncompleted the survey (presentation: n = 71) or a sample who responded to \nrecruitment announcements inviting them to learn study tips by reading an \narticle and to earn extra credit by participating in the study (article: n = 51).\nTable 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the participants. \nBoth groups consisted largely of first- and second-year students (presentation: \n91.2%; article: 91.3%). The students in the presentation group were statistically \nsimilar to those in the article group in age ( p = .052) and year in college ( p = \n.061).

The presentation and article sessions then \noccurred simultaneously in adjacent classrooms. Students in the presentation \ngroup spent one hour attending the live \u201cStudy Smarter, Not Harder\u201d presenta -\ntion and participating in the demonstrations associated with it. Students in the \narticle group spent one hour reading the \u201cOptimizing Learning in College\u201d article \nand taking notes over it. Students who finished reading the article before the \nfull hour elapsed were encouraged to reread the article and to add to their notes \nuntil the session ended. At the conclusion of the hour, students ate pizza \nprovided by the experimenters and received extra credit for attending the session.\nDuring the second year of the study, we presented the \u201cStudy Smarter, Not \nHarder\u201d presentation to a group of more than 150 incoming first-year students as \npart of their campus orientation activities. In October, we again offered the \npresentation to a small group of students living in a campus dorm. In total, 169 \nstudents attended one of the two presentations, which were the same as that \ndelivered to the students in the experimental study the previous year.

We adjusted the critical p -value using the Bonferroni correction ( p = \n.05/4 = .0125) to reduce the likelihood of committing a type 1 error. Students \nwho attended the presentation reported using tips more frequently post- \nsession than at baseline, as well as using non-tips more frequently post- \nsession than at baseline.

Although we did not find \nthat students who attended the presentation rated the tips as more effective or \nhelpful or reported using the tips more frequently than article readers as we \nhad hypothesized, both groups recognized the effectiveness and helpfulness of \nthe recommended tips over other commonly used study strategies. Even more \nimportantly, both groups reported using the recommended study tips more \noften after they learned about them than they had prior to participating in this \nresearch study. This outcome is particularly positive given that past research \nhas, at times, noted a mismatch between students\u2019 perceptions of the help -\nfulness of study strategies and their willingness to actually put those same \nstrategies to use after study tip instruction (Balsh, 2001 ).

They also suggest \nthat participants in our study studied \u201charder\u201d after learning about recom -\nmended study strategies than they did before they attended the research \nsession. This is not necessarily a negative outcome given that more study \ntime may improve learning relative to less study time (e.g., Mazzoni & \nCornoldi, 1993 ; Nelson & Leonesio, 1988 ; Pelegrina et al., 2000 ). However, \nour goal was to help students study \u201csmarter,\u201d using more effective techniques \nand abandoning less effective techniques to make the time they spend studying \nmore efficient.\nIn this way, contrary to our expectations, the \u201cOptimizing Learning in \nCollege\u201d article outperformed the \u201cStudy Smarter, Not Harder\u201d presentation. \nStudents who read the article better discriminated the effectiveness and help -\nfulness of recommended study tips over other popular study approaches than \nstudents who attended the presentation.

First, the \u201cOptimizing Learning\u201d article was lengthy and \nincluded more study techniques overall than the presentation.

We do not believe that the \nmore information-focused article approach outperformed the more active \ndemonstration-filled presentation approach in our study due to differences \nin how students learn in these two types of environments. Past research has \nclearly documented the superiority of active over passive learning (Deslauriers \net al., 2019 , 2011 ; Deslauriers & Wieman, 2011 ; Freeman et al., 2014 ). Rather, \nwe believe that the article outperformed the presentation because of the \nspecific information that was communicated (or not communicated) to stu -\ndents by each. Active learning environments should certainly result in greater \ngains in knowledge than more passive ones, but this only holds true if what is \nbeing taught in that active learning environment is as thorough and compre -\nhensive as what is being taught in the more passive learning setting. Thus, the \nresults of the current study suggest that the \u201cStudy Smarter, Not Harder\u201d \npresentation, as well as other presentations or classes designed to teach \nstudents effective study skills and habits, should dedicate time and attention \nto teaching students which techniques are not effective in addition to which \ntechniques are effective to help them utilize their study time most efficaciously.\nFinally, the majority of the presentation attendees learned about the study \ntips before they began their collegiate career (i.e., during their first-year \norientation or very early in their first semester on campus). In contrast, \nbecause we recruited many of the article readers later in the academic year, \nthe article group had slightly more experience in college classrooms when they \nparticipated in the study than their presentation-attending peers. Thus, they \nmay have had a better sense of what techniques do not work through their past \nattempts to use them without success. This wisdom may have helped them to \nachieve better discrimination between tips and non-tips as a result of their \nparticipation in this study. Future studies might investigate the best timing for \nteaching students to study effectively. Although we have generally assumed \nthat the sooner, the better, students somewhat more advanced in their educa -\ntion might be better suited to benefit from study skill instruction due to their \nricher past experiences with what is not effective in college classrooms.\nTogether, these results suggest that spending an hour reading the \n\u201cOptimizing Learning in College\u201d article improved students\u2019 study habits \nmore than attending an hour-long \u201cStudy Smarter, Not Harder\u201d presentation \ndid. This study only compared one article to one presentation; comparing other \narticles and presentations (or other presenters delivering this presentation) \nmight yield different results. Thus, our results might not speak to the type of \napproach to use when teaching study tips as much as it offers suggestions about \nwhat to include in study tips lessons (which approaches are not effective) and \nwhen to offer those recommendations to students (after they have had time to \nacclimate to collegiate courses).

One line of her \nresearch focuses on students and how to maximize their learning in class and outside of class. \nIn addition, she is interested in how factors such as mood and emotion can impact our ability \nto monitor the contextual details of our memories. Dr. Hall collaborates with undergraduate \nstudents in all of her research projects and she enjoys developing new research ideas based on \nthe ideas and insights of her students.\n184\n T. T.

She was actively involved in two primary research labs during her \ntime at Butler, one with Dr. Tara Lineweaver and one with Dr. Ali O\u2019Malley. Ms. Throgmorton \nassisted with numerous research projects, but primarily focused her efforts around student \nstudy habits and Butler\u2019s Music in Long-Term Care study. She has since transitioned into a role \nfocused on identifying optimal career opportunities for individuals and providing training and \nresources to help them grow in desired skill sets, setting them up for success in new career \npaths.\nSean M. Callahan earned Bachelor\u2019s degrees in both Biology and Chemistry from Butler \nUniversity in 2020. During his time at Butler, he was actively involved in Dr. Lineweaver\u2019s \nlab, where he studied the effects of music on sundowning symptoms in patients with \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease. He was also involved in virology research through the Biology depart -\nment. He studied the structure and growth mechanics of mouse hepatitis virus, a noninfectious \ncoronavirus, and he coauthored a review paper on the variations in clinical and laboratory \nstrains of respiratory syncytial virus. Mr. Callahan is currently working on his osteopathic \nmedical degree from the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine (CCOM). During his \nfirst year at CCOM, he was involved in logistics and vaccine administration for the Johnson \nand Johnson vaccine trial at Great Lakes Clinical Trials in Chicago, IL. He currently studies the \neffects of carcinogens and high fat diets on mouse lung tissue and is very interested in the \nmedical specialties of Cardiology and Pulmonology.\nAlexis J. Bell was an undergraduate student at Butler University from 2018-2020. She was \na Psychology major and a Neuroscience minor. During her two years at Butler, she was \na student scientist in Dr. Tara Lineweaver\u2019s lab. She assisted with a number of research studies \nincluding the Music and Dementia project that involved generating and playing individualized \nmusic playlists for older adult nursing home residents with dementia. She also served as \na student co-leader on the current project, which was designed to compare the effectiveness \nof a study tips presentation to that of reading an article explaining the same study tips as ways \nto improve college students\u2019 everyday study habits.\nORCID\nTara T.

Yet, there are various obstacles to applying a STEM education in\nthe context of preparing students for a scienti\ufb01cally and technologically advanced society. There has\nbeen little research on how engineering can be incorporated into the elementary school curriculum.\nThis study, thus, provides a systematic review of the learning techniques and structured framework\nthat are used to support learning in the \ufb01elds of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\n(STEM). It also aids in identifying students\u2019 shifts in interest toward STEM subjects, as well as their\ndesire to pursue future STEM-based careers. This study makes use of a systematic literature review\nof high-impact journals with a Q1 or Q2 ranking. It was also found that there are hurdles in regard\nto the teaching approach that is used for STEM subjects. This suggests that there are numerous\nopportunities that can be exploited by educators in their hunt for a better STEM teaching approach.\nFinally, researchers must create features that enable students to gain fundamental competencies\nwithin the STEM disciplines. Future applications must include the experimental support for the\npurposes of inquiry-based learning activities.\nKeywords: STEM education; framework; integrated model; teaching learning perspectives\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Background of STEM\nIn STEM education\u2014which is often referred to as a standards-based meta-discipline\nat the school level\u2014all teachers, particularly those who teach STEM subjects, employ an\nintegrated approach in regard to teaching and learning. Discipline-speci\ufb01c content, in this\ntype of method, is addressed and treated as a single, \ufb02uid study, rather than divided. This\nde\ufb01nition of STEM education was provided by Merrill [1]. Simply put, STEM education\nis the teaching of four distinct subjects to students: science, technology, engineering, and\nmathematics (collectively shortened to STEM). In order to better prepare students for a job\nand to consider real-world applications, STEM incorporates all four of these disciplines\ninto one, rather than instructing through just one of them. Due to its bene\ufb01ts across a\nwide range of sectors, STEM education has grown to be more signi\ufb01cant for the world.\nThe STEM \ufb01elds indirectly contribute signi\ufb01cantly to the health of the economy, due to\nthe majority of industries that rely on them. The environmental and social consequences\nof the twenty-\ufb01rst century, which risk international security and economic stability, may\nbe the driving force behind the urgent need for improved STEM education worldwide.\nIt is widely acknowledged that improving STEM education can help solve a variety of\nsocietal dif\ufb01culties, including the depletion of natural resources and problems in regard\nto climate change [2]. This chapter suggests a useful theoretical framework that countries\nmay adopt and/or adapt to ensure the success of their STEM education. In order to meet\nEduc.

Sci.2023, 13, 1 2 of 19\nthe major issues of the twenty-\ufb01rst century, the purpose of STEM education is for STEM\npractitioners to strive to improve the workforce in the STEM sectors and to foster STEM\nliteracy [3]. Many educational institutions and decision-makers worldwide are focused in\ndeveloping competencies in STEM domains, driven by real or perceived current and future\nframeworks. However, there are a variety of perspectives on the nature and growth of\npro\ufb01ciencies in STEM education, and a greater emphasis on integration raises new issues\nand calls for more research [4,5].\nThe approach of two or more STEM domains bound by STEM activities in an authentic\nenvironment is what we refer to as an integrated STEM education, in general. The goal is\nto connect these disciplines in order to improve learning [6]. The limitations of this strategy\nfor teaching integrated STEM education are acknowledged by the authors. This strategy\u2019s\nemphasis on STEM activities and the real-world application of STEM and science may\nnot be able to deliver real-world engineering design applications or conventional STEM\npractices, due to the limitations of the available technology [4]. Additionally, each STEM\nsubject is required to be taught in a way that fosters literacy and problem-solving abilities\n(which is knowledge that may be seen by some as being overly career-focused). Certain\nauthors (Bozkurt and Sema; Li and Schoenfeld) [7,8] noted that not all situations will allow\nfor the proposed approach to be used, in order to teach STEM, which may restrict the\nsubject matter that may be covered. As an example, there could be certain theoretically\noriented skills in math [9] that are neglected. In regard to the decision-making skills that are\ndeveloped through STEM education, people can better comprehend and deal with a variety\nof real-world issues. It is believed that engaging in STEM learning activities would help\nstudents develop certain abilities, such as creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, and\ndecision-making, while certain issues within the humanities, such as in politics, economics,\nand society can also be seen as being connected to STEM knowledge [ 10]. Creating a\ncross-cutting STEM framework is dif\ufb01cult; it necessitates that teachers teach STEM material\npurposefully in order to ensure that students comprehend how STEM knowledge is applied\nto real-world issues [ 11]. Crosscutting connections can still be present, although they\nare currently implicit or even absent. Students who know little to nothing about the\npertinent concepts in the many disciplines \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to connect ideas across disciplines.\nAdditionally, students do not necessarily or naturally use their disciplinary knowledge in\nintegrated contexts [12]. If there is no systematic method employed for the purposes of a\nbetter execution of teaching, increased STEM subject integration may not be more bene\ufb01cial.\nHowever, a well-integrated framework offers students chances in which to study in more\npertinent and engaging situations, as well as fostering the application of higher level critical\nthinking abilities, enhancing problem-solving abilities, and boosting student retention [2].\nIt is important to have a solid conceptual and basic grasp as to how students acquire and\napply STEM content before developing a strategic approach toward integrating it.\nDue to its potential to support lifelong learning, which is regarded as an\nall-encompassing concept in knowledge economies, learning how to learn (LHTL) has\nrecently gained prominence in educational policy and practice discourses. As the term\n\u201clifelong learning\u201d implies, students must not only learn in school but also develop the\nskills and habits that will allow them to continue learning into adulthood as knowledge\nadvances rapidly. Learning to learn refers to the capacity to pursue and maintain learning,\nto plan one\u2019s own learning, including ef\ufb01cient time and information management, both\nindividually and in groups. This competency is being aware of one\u2019s own learning process\nand needs, being able to recognize opportunities that are accessible, and being able to go\nthrough challenges in order to learn more effectively. This competency entails acquiring, in-\ntegrating, and processing new information and abilities, as well as looking for and utilizing\nguidance. This should all be conducted in order to use and apply knowledge and skills in a\nrange of contexts, such as at home, at work, in education, and training.\nIn order to assist students in developing practical cognitive maps, connecting ideas,\nand addressing misconceptions, teachers must possess a solid understanding of the subject\nmatter and possess a strong ability to adapt.

A growing body of research indicates that this\ntype of professional development bene\ufb01ts students\u2019 learning, as well as teachers\u2019 con\ufb01dence\nin their teaching, particularly when it comes to the more dif\ufb01cult types of learning that the\nnew standards require. The most likely way to encourage greater achievement in children,\nespecially those for whom education is the only means of survival and success, is to develop\na profession of teaching in which teachers have the opportunity for lifelong learning.\nSTEM educators do not consistently embrace STEM education in the context of op-\nerations. A conceptual framework for STEM education may therefore be advantageous\nfor them. The process of incorporating science, technology, engineering, and math in\nreal-world situations can be just as complicated as the global issues that call for a new\ngeneration of STEM professionals [13]. Teachers reportedly \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to draw links\nbetween the STEM subjects, according to educational studies. Due to the lack of links\nto cross-cutting ideas and practical applications, students who learn science and math\nin a disconnected and isolated manner frequently lose interest in those subjects [ 14,15].\nIn this study, the core principles of STEM and learning theories will be combined in or-\nder to provide a framework for an integrated STEM education, which will help with\nfuture research.\nThis article is sectioned into four parts. Section 1 is about the background introduction\nof STEM, the research questions, and the study implications. Section 2 describes a detailed\nliterature review of the available frameworks in the \ufb01eld of STEM education. In Section 3,\nthe proposed framework is developed by the integration of an existing literature study, and\nsome new suggestions are also given. Finally, the study ends with the conclusions of the\nstudy, the study limitations, and the future scope, as described in Section 4.\n1.2. Research Questions\nSome of the research questions looked at in this research paper include the following:\nQ1: What effective learning techniques (i.e., methods in regard to learning how to\nlearn) can be used by teachers to better teach the integrated science (STEM-based) subjects?\nQ2: How can these learning techniques (i.e., techniques in regard to learning how\nto learn) be used in a well-structured framework in order to serve the integration of\nscience strands?\n2. Research Methods\nThis work adheres to the principles of the preferred reporting items for systematic\nreviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method. According to the assertions of Syafril et al.\n(2021) [16], such a method promotes transparency while helping to perform a systematic\nliterature review. Further, it features a \ufb02ow chart that lists the components that are required\nfor study. PRISMA 2020 enables thorough reporting, guarantees that readers can evaluate\nthe suitability of the methodologies utilized, and, in essence, ensures the veracity of a\nstudy\u2019s conclusions. The presentation and summary of the studies contained in this\napproach are conducted in relation to a particular context [17]. PRISMA 2020 is, thus, able\nto help produce literature that possesses results that can be compared between studies due\nto this. The PRISMA 2020 \ufb02ow chart demonstrates how the chosen articles were initially\nchosen from a wide sample, screened in accordance with the information requirements of\nthe study, how their eligibility \ufb01ts in, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria employed\nby the researcher. Researchers can conduct more systematic literature searches by using\nthe PRISMA checklist and suggestion list. The selection of secondary data in this study\naccounted for the abstract, title, background information or introduction, \ufb01ndings, research\nmethodology, and discussion.\n2.1.

As a result of the COVID-19\npandemic\u2019s unexpected onset and the ensuing school closings, educators and educational\nsystems all over the world have made signi\ufb01cant efforts to adapt and innovate. Remote\nlearning became widely available in many institutions and educational systems almost\novernight. Whatever the results, for varied lengths of time, remote learning became the\nstandard technique of delivering education. Teachers reacted quickly and with excellent\nsupport in response to the changes in how lessons were delivered. Thus, it is evident and\nwidely acknowledged that \u201cthis crisis has fostered innovation within the STEM education\nsector,\u201d and the purpose of this article is to, therefore, highlight the research conducted as a\nresult of this paradox. For this reason, the researchers chose to include papers and empirical\nstudies from 2019 to 2022. Due to the lack of current information, the researcher did not\nuse any older research papers. At the same time, publications from non-peer-reviewed\nsources and those from unscholarly internet platforms were also omitted from the review.\nReliability and validity were ensured by only referencing empirical papers.\n2.2. Data Sources\nElectronic databases, including SCOPUS and SCImago, with high-impact journal\narticles, were utilized by the researcher. In addition to looking at how the data related\nto the study\u2019s context, these platforms were investigated accordingly for the reliability\nof their publications [18]. Data were gathered for the study via a search query that was\ncomprehensive enough to include all of the pertinent literature without leaving out any\nkey papers that are pertinent to the investigation.\nFigure 1 explains the process employed by the researcher to select the applicable data\nsources that will best help the researcher in answering the framed exploration questions. As\nthe original step, applicable journals and papers were uprooted from the Scopus database\nusing STEM-speci\ufb01c keywords. The papers were also \ufb01ltered using speci\ufb01c keywords\nsimilar to STEM education, frame, integrated model, tutoring-learning perspectives, and\nlearning how to learn. The reader can be assured that only open-access papers published\nbetween 2019 and 2022 were used in this exploration. Open-access papers were named\nwhile keeping in mind the interests of future researchers who wished to probe further\non STEM education, its factors, the ways of learning how to learn, and the conception of\nlearning how to learn itself, among others. In order to further enhance the searchability of\nthis exploration, it was decided to exclude the journals published on trusted websites but\nwere in languages other than English, due to the sole reason that English is a universally\naccepted language, in itself. Likewise, the academic nature of this exploration was saved\nby simply considering research articles and review articles that suggested a framework for\nSTEM education.\nTable 1.

Discussion on the Research Questions\nQuestion 1: What effective learning techniques (i.e., methods of learning how to learn) can be\nused by teachers, in order to teach integrated science (i.e., STEM-based subjects)?\nSTEM can be a very technical subject to handle, if taken literally. It is always very\nimportant to craft methods carefully, in order to ensure the maximum content adminis-\ntration when dealing with STEM-related issues [ 33]. In order to effectively answer this\nquestion, we will need to go through some key methods that one may use to teach STEM to\ntheir children. To better keep your learners interested, it could be worthwhile to vary your\ncourses and employ various teaching methods, as these strategies are helpful [ 34]. The\nfollowing can be just some of the ways that can be used to effectively teach STEM-based\nsubjects.\nA. Use of Project-Based Learning\nThis approach encourages students to engage in projects that will help them develop\nnew abilities and put their knowledge to use. They will need to dedicate a great amount\nof time to study the issue at hand and to come up with a solution. STEM project-based\nlearning can take numerous forms, such as designing an app or creating a model of a\nbridge. Furthermore, STEM project-based learning necessitates a professional teaching\nforce equipped with the knowledge and skills required to create learning experiences that\nmaximize the student potential [8,35]. As a result, effective STEM PBL requires teachers\nwho are receiving high-quality professional development, in order to learn how to design\nexcellent experiential learning activities [36]. An example of great project-based learning\ncenters on real-world problems, thereby establishing a clear link between what is learned\nin school and how it applies outside of the classroom. As these problems and issues are\nauthentic, they are complex and messy, which renders it essential for students to draw\non knowledge from multiple disciplines and expertise in a variety of \ufb01elds [ 2]. When\nconsidering these problems, innovators in our economy do not limit themselves to one\narea; they investigate and draw from \u201cscienti\ufb01c, mathematical, artistic, or social elements\u201d\nas they work, in order to develop solutions [27].\nB. Use of Problem-Based Learning\nProblem-based learning is a student-centered approach in which students learn about a\nsubject by working in groups to solve an open-ended problem. This problem is what drives\nthe motivation and the learning [6]. There are some similarities between this approach and\nproject-based learning, but the main distinction is that the students here must analyze and\nassess an issue that is given to them. As there is typically more than one correct solution to\nan issue, this calls for a high level of thought. This strategy fosters leadership, collaboration,\nand creativity. Problem-based learning is providing students with new ways to learn STEM\nsubjects [32,34,35]. It is critical to provide students with the fundamental understanding\nand tools of problem-based learning with the goal and optimism of producing more skilled\nworkers in STEM \ufb01elds. Asking one\u2019s pupils to develop their own business proposals in\norder to address a societal need is an illustration of PBL [27].\nC. Use of Inquiry-Based Learning\nStudents are encouraged to pore over the material and submit as many questions as\nthey prefer. This is performed in this way due to the fact that the major goal of inquiry-\nbased learning is to emphasize the student\u2019s role in the learning process. Furthermore,\nthe abilities of critical thinking, questioning, and problem-solving are all fostered through\nthis type of learning. Due to the fact that it will be student led, the pupils will have to\nchoose the questions they wish to pursue [ 22,37]. It is the responsibility of the teacher\nto foster inquiry and encourage re\ufb02ection. Inquiry-based learning begins with questions\nderived from children\u2019s and young people\u2019s everyday experiences. Children are constantly\nobserving the phenomena of their surroundings and daily lives [9,38,39]. They describe,\ncontrast, and interpret their experiences. This is a great method of learning as it encourages\nthe children to ask questions and quench their curiosity.

An inquiry-based STEAM\nclassroom combines terminology and content learning with active processes. Students can\nelaborate on concepts and processes, as well as evaluate or assess their understandings in\nlight of available pieces of evidence [14].\nThe above techniques can only serve their purpose if they are used in accordance with\nthe perspectives of science. Teaching science, especially at the higher grade levels, requires\na somewhat different approach than the one we always imagine. In order to effectively\nuse the techniques mentioned above and enable them to serve their intended purpose, the\ntechniques must be applied in a typical science learning model.

Approaches to the Curriculum Integration\nA multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approach to curriculum\nintegration is described by Ruto [40] who made it clear that \u201cone position is not superior to\nanother; rather, different approaches are more appropriate than others, according to the\ncontext in which they are used\u201d.\nA theme or current issue is frequently used in multidisciplinary approaches to connect\ndisparate academic areas. A multidisciplinary approach would identify each discipline\nwithin the curriculum [12,27]. This strategy could be used in a single classroom or through\ncurricular alignment in classes covering many topic areas. Interdisciplinary approaches\nspan subject boundaries, emphasize interdisciplinary content and skills, and connect\ndisciplines beyond a single theme or concern. As a result, it would be challenging to\nclearly discern between each discipline. Real-world problems, not disparate topic areas,\nare the emphasis of transdisciplinary approaches, which connect social, political, economic,\ninternational, and environmental concerns [ 41]. Similar to the research on curriculum\nintegration, integrated STEM has been divided into disciplinary and transdisciplinary\nmethods as shown in Table 3 below [42].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3292, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4a1709e-c310-4076-b6ad-1147137c38f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4a1709e-c310-4076-b6ad-1147137c38f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "education-13-00001-v2.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/education-13-00001-v2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 816301, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "72091074-8b5f-4cdd-ac09-9b36a2e42c35", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "education-13-00001-v2.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/education-13-00001-v2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 816301, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "f83841863c3cb38722acb3cea4d17b420632afbfbd2aef8cc6bb61bbe96767d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Educ.

The engineering design method is widely used in STEM education. There\nare different variations of this approach, but they all include students \ufb01rst evaluating their\nsolutions, then trying to improve them [43]. As it necessitates persistence, as well as the\nunderstanding that solutions can always be improved upon, this revision process is crucial\nto STEM; this is because STEM problems can be solved in a variety of ways. The function\nof the instructor in this type of STEM instruction is described via STEM pedagogy [27,37].\nB. STEAM: Integrating with the Arts\nThere have been certain STEM approaches that were developed for the purposes of\nintegrating the arts, in order to provide pupils with equal access to STEM content. This\npaper speci\ufb01cally describes an analysis of curricula that incorporate the arts and sciences,\nin order to inform the more general \ufb01elds of STEM and STEAM education [12]. There must\nbe an acknowledgement that different educational groups may have different de\ufb01nitions\nfor the terms of science, art, STEM, and STEAM. In order to provide children with more\nfair learning opportunities, we must speci\ufb01cally integrate the arts with inquiry-based\nteaching strategies and to examine the integration patterns. Another approach that allows\nstudents to explore multiple content areas at the same time is through arts integration [44].\nArts integration involves students learning any type of subject matter through the arts.\nThis implies that any subject could be taught by relating it to a standard in the arts that\nis organically connected. Students have more opportunity to share their thoughts with\ntheir peers through art, in particular, using all of their linguistic and semiotic resources for\nmeaning-making [18,34]. Additionally, employing arts-based solutions involves students\nin the creative process, which helps students learn new languages and lower their affective\n\ufb01lters [31]. Through the use of the arts, scienti\ufb01c instruction enables students to engage with\nthe subject in ways that go beyond what is typically regarded as \u201cacademic\u201d or \u201cacceptable\u201d\nin a science classroom.\nC.

This process was made\nworse during the COVID-19 period, when teachers had numerous dif\ufb01culties in addressing\nstudents\u2019 needs for participation in face-to-face events when it was not possible. This was in\naddition to needing to motivate and engage the students in their learning [4,11]. Following\nthis period of becoming familiar with online learning and assessment, it was necessary to\ngo back to the old educational strategies\u2014which needed to be improved by implementing\nnew teaching strategies\u2014and combining those developed in online activities with those\nrelated to addressing the needs of students who were neglected. These included teamwork,\nre\ufb02ection, face-to-face project execution, STEM education involvement, technological in-\ntegration in all activities, and the need to speed up learning [18,27]. Once switching back\nto face-to-face interactions, the incorporation of computational thinking in educational\nactivities can still help to address these types of student needs.\nD. Integration using the Central Project Approach\nThe central project approach is a teacher-led method that revolves a central activ-\nity around a teacher, or team of teachers, integrating the STEM topics. The teaching\nand learning processes can often take place at two levels when using the central project\napproach [24,46]. Direct instruction is combined with group work, integrated problem-\nsolving, and indirect learning episodes. However, the students are still \u201ctaught\u201d in distinct\ndiscipline-based groups in the direct teaching segment. This gives the teacher the assur-\nance that particular areas of important information are covered by the pupils and ensures\nthat certain key concepts and ideas are addressed by the students [27]. The students are\nthen exposed to indirect learning episodes during this process when they work in small\ngroups to investigate and create original designs that expand on their notions in response\nto genuine design dif\ufb01culties [47]. The students are required to write down their thoughts\ncollectively and attempt to connect them to the knowledge they are gaining in each of their\ndirect teaching lessons. They are urged to discuss what they have learned and thought\nabout in their many lessons, as well as to strive to combine them, in order to synthesize\ntheir knowledge [10].\n4. Suggestions and Implications from the Study\n4.1. Suggesting a New Framework\nThere is no speci\ufb01ed methodology that can improve the STEM educations in one\nstep. It is a continuous process that requires the multi concept integration. Here, from the\nabove literature analysis, is a set of four steps that are de\ufb01ned to improve the teaching\neffectiveness of STEM education.\nStep 1: Understanding the Core Difference between Learning and Teaching\nTraditional education focuses on teaching, rather than learning. It incorrectly assumes\nthat for every ounce of teaching, there is an ounce of learning by those who are taught.\nIn Table 4, there is a concise comparison that differentiate between these two concepts.\nStudents should be provided with a wide range of STEAM learning options from which to\nchoose or experiment during the educational process. They do not have to learn everything\nin the same way [35]. Figure 2 shows a clear structure of how they should learn from an\nearly age that learning how to learn is largely their responsibility.\nTable 4.

Students conduct their own research, develop a solution,\npresent their \ufb01ndings to teachers and community members, and assess their own progress\nas they go [3,49]. Teachers assist in guiding this process, but students are responsible for\nthe content, timing, and motivation. Providing students with introductory autonomous\nassignments and assisting them in setting goals for those assignments are two of the most\nimportant steps to take in implementing SCL effectively [41].

STEM education is a teaching approach that integrates\nscience, technology, engineering, and math. The arts have the \u201cpotential to expand the\nlimitations of STEM education and application,\u201d according to the STEM Education Guide,\nwhich also includes STEAM. The Institution for Art Integration and STEAM claim that\nthe goals of STEAM are to foster student debate and problem-solving, while simultane-\nously fostering the development of practical skills and a love of teamwork. Exploratory,\nexpand, engage, and assess are the stages of the suggested framework for STEM learning\nthat are used in classrooms. Teachers serve as mentors and facilitators for students as\nthey apply STEM learning in order to develop their critical thinking skills. The \ufb01ndings\nsuggest that these constructs can explain a large portion of the students\u2019 pathways to\nSTEM careers and learning, emphasizing the importance of youth STEM interest. Being\na scientist is a high-status job that comes with a respectable personal income and social\nstanding. Additionally, science has historically adhered to a standard that is distinct from\nother high-status professions, i.e., in universalism. This suggests that the best way to\njudge a scientist\u2019s work is to apply universalistic (or meritocratic) standards, rather than\nfunctionally irrelevant variables, such as gender, color, national origin, or af\ufb01liation with a\nparticular religion. This suggests that STEM education may be more universalistic than\nnon-STEM education, in the sense that a student\u2019s performance may be assessed more\nobjectively in a STEM topic than in a non-STEM one. If so, STEM education can be seen as a\nmeans of promoting individual social mobility, enabling those from socially disadvantaged\nbackgrounds to succeed through objectively measurable standards that are recognized by\nSTEM educators. In fact, this hypothesis has been put forth to explain why Asian Ameri-\ncans are overrepresented in science and engineering since World War II [23,24]. However,\nthe general education system\u2019s dynamics include STEM education. A signi\ufb01cant amount\nof economic literature, which has grown signi\ufb01cantly in recent decades (especially for\nthe highly educated), sees education as a kind of human capital that produces signi\ufb01cant\neconomic bene\ufb01ts. STEM education generally commands a premium in the labor market,\ndespite the fact that basic scientists\u2019 salaries have stagnated in recent years. However, a\nsubstantial body of sociological research on educational strati\ufb01cation shows that social\nfactors, such as race and ethnicity, family structure, socioeconomic status of the family, and\nfamily size have a big impact on educational attainment [30]. Therefore, the study of STEM\nis very important in analyzing the scienti\ufb01c gaps in our education system. By evaluating\nthe STEM systems, education reforms are well scrutinized; thus any necessary inputs are\nwell sought after. STEM has already been highly emphasized in various education reforms\nin various countries in the world, including the United States of America, China, Japan,\nand a number of European countries. As such, its fruits have been realized [22]. Some of\nthe fruits of STEM incorporation into the education system is an increased number of new\ninnovations, such as the TESLA technology and more innovative ideas in the Silicon Valley\nof California. Moreover, Reed [52] stressed that technology education must continue to be\ndeveloped on the pillars that characterize discipline, in terms of content and must maintain\nits relevance as a STEM discipline. There is also a general feeling that the implementation\nof the STEM program at schools that have been selected to initiate implementation will\nbe negatively impacted, due to the high cost of implementing the program. The state\nof the national economy post-COVID-19 will not be stable and thus will not have the\nmuscle to fully support these \ufb01elds. It is also suggested that donor funding to support\nSTEM implementation may decline as donor countries are also not immune from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n5. Conclusions\n5.1.

This study demonstrates that a combination approach can\nsigni\ufb01cantly improve students\u2019 learning and raising their performance. According to the\npublished research, educating students\u2019 critical thinking, problem solving, and commu-\nnication skills, is essential in preparing them for the 21st century. Student needs must be\ntaken into consideration due to the emphasis on STEM education as a means of ensuring\nfuture success. The authors argue that children have greater access to STEM achievement\nby including the arts in STEM education, turning the approach into STEAM. Therefore, the\nauthors propose a new model to show how STEM education should be implemented in the\nclassroom [32]. The general goals are explained below:\n1. To teach problem-solving skills in a scienti\ufb01c context: In addition to learning how\nto solve a clearly de\ufb01ned scienti\ufb01c problem, students should have the opportunity\nto spot anomalies and inconsistencies in poorly structured problems. As a result,\nthey will be encouraged to recognize problems more clearly, which is a skill that\nis crucial for problem solving. All of these classroom exercises will support the\nstudents\u2019 creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. They may offer original\nanswers to pressing issues or create a new way of thinking about the matter (e.g.,\nthrough problem stories about car speed, body temperature, genetic probability, and\nchemistry) [53];\n2. To generalize problem-solving techniques through exercise practice: A problem\u2019s\nnature will frequently dictate the appropriate kind of solution to use. Calculate, sim-\nplify, use an equation, create a model, diagram, table or chart, or work backwards,\nare some common methods for addressing problems. Students may probably ex-\nperience periods of frustration or uncertainty as they learn how to solve problems\ncreatively [2,10];\n3. To increase the student motivation by incorporating art and musical elements into the\nlesson: Visual arts, social studies, history, the \ufb01ne arts, music, and physical arts are all\nexamples of \u201cArt\u201d in STEAM. As well as their use in fostering \ufb02exibility, adaptability,\nproductivity, responsibility, and innovation\u2014all necessary qualities for a successful\ncareer in any \ufb01eld of study\u2014art is about harnessing creativity and imagination, in\norder to advance the development of STEM\u2019s core competencies. The learner is\nviewed as an individual in the music achievement motivation model, with particular\nattribution and self-perception traits. Music-related activities are typically group-\nfocused. It is not inconsistent with the model to sacri\ufb01ce oneself for the good of the\ngreater whole (e.g., visual outlines, frequencies, and pitches of sounds);\n4. To encourage \ufb02exibility in using different forms of technology whenever necessary\n(e.g., iPad, apps, calculator, PowerPoint): Phones and other technologies are frequently\nused in day to day life. As such, it seems to make sense that learning how to use them\nand to make the most of what they can do should begin in schools, in order to prepare\nstudents for their future in a technologically advanced world. You might ask students\nto use their phones, in order to conduct research or to include online learning tools in\nthe class [3];\n5. To always establish a connection with a real-world example: Making links between\nwhat is being taught in the classroom and what is happening in the real world and\nincreasing student awareness of global issues, are only two bene\ufb01ts of incorporating\ncurrent events into the classroom. Students who are encouraged to follow the latest\nnews acquire a more responsible outlook and are better equipped to function in a\nglobalized and multi-cultural economy, due to the fact that they gain access to a wide\nrange of cultural, social, and political perspectives they may otherwise have not been\nexposed to [28].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4340, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0babb0ac-1a27-4d0a-b704-1fbe19d84b89": {"__data__": {"id_": "0babb0ac-1a27-4d0a-b704-1fbe19d84b89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "education-13-00001-v2.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/education-13-00001-v2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 816301, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "25fd16c4-486d-4b7c-8a22-cf4a239c4a5e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "education-13-00001-v2.pdf", "file_path": "Artigos/education-13-00001-v2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 816301, "creation_date": "2025-01-19", "last_modified_date": "1980-01-01"}, "hash": "b556bf83519cf8e812a550357b510c3815aa0cceb45d0fcc189e1b439f1a9d41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e21094f-a1c3-4ebe-9786-73d92e217b40", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4f6c0d4ff66486c565295dfc663193f4da457eefac3b74cdc26663742ce76f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Educ. Sci.2023, 13, 1 17 of 19\nThe author\u2019s framework for a problem-solving approach provides teachers with a\nuseful foundation for integrated STEM teaching, while providing students with enough\nreal-world experience [10]. The authors predict that students will have the knowledge and\nskills needed to deal with dif\ufb01cult real-world situations. While there are many reasons\nthat contribute to the success of STEM education, teacher teaching methods that encourage\ngrowth are the most important element of this transition. This is because it depends on the\nteacher\u2019s skill level, understanding, and association with STEM education [29,46]. More\nhelp will be needed for teachers in the form of frameworks, professional development, ma-\nterial development, etc. The training and retraining, research, monitoring, and evaluation\nof STEM education are all guided by theoretical frameworks, such as STEME. Nonetheless,\nmost importantly, the science technology engineering math environment (STEME) theoreti-\ncal framework fosters among stakeholders a common understanding of the purpose and\nspirit of STEM education [11].\n5.2. Limitation and Future Scope\nWe attempted to systematically review the methodology for the \ufb01rst time within this\nstudy. Further, the lessons we learnt from it will help us move forward with other research\nprojects. While these materials may be helpful to practitioners, we conducted this study\nfrom the standpoint of an empirical researcher. As such, we chose to eliminate from this\nsystematic review, any papers that were teacher re\ufb02ective accounts [9]. We strictly focused\non investigating the experimental applications of the funds of the knowledge paradigm,\nalthough practitioners may learn more by reading the re\ufb02ective perspectives. In order to\nseparate platform and content-related variables, if the study were to be repeated, we would\nneed to specify newly developed or modi\ufb01ed versions of currently available technologies\nthat could use the same material across all experimental technological platforms [12]. Only\njournals that were included in the SSCI database\u2019s index were used to review the articles\nfor this study. In regard to the \ufb01eld, articles published in periodicals with indexes in the\nScopus database were crucial. This study only includes experimental investigations that\nwere written up as articles. However, the study can be extended toward the other types\nof scholarly articles. One can extend the study to investigate certain other sample groups\nincluding preschool, special educational needs children, and vocational training, which\nwere not included in these studies on STEM education.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, O.A.K. and Y.A.; methodology, O.A.K.; software, A.A.D.;\nvalidation, O.A.K. and A.A.D.; formal analysis, O.A.K.; investigation, Y.A.; resources, O.A.K.; data\ncuration, O.A.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.A.D.; writing\u2014review and editing, O.A.K.;\nvisualization, Y.A.; supervision, O.A.K.; project administration, O.A.K.

Inserida no meio educacional, ela oportuniza ao professor\ndiferentes formas de dinamizar as aulas, tornando-as interessantes para os alunos. Por isso, repensar as\npr\u00e1ticas e o processo pedag\u00f3gico \u00e9 importante para se adquirir uma educa\u00e7\u00e3o de qualidade. Da mesma forma\nsurgem a neuroeduca\u00e7\u00e3o e a neurodid\u00e1tica que, como disciplinas, fortalecem cada vez mais o ensino e a\naprendizagem atrav\u00e9s do entendimento de como o c\u00e9rebro funciona. Compreender essa din\u00e2mica \u00e9 garantir\naos alunos uma aula mais bem elaborada, baseada em muita reflex\u00e3o. Portanto, essa pesquisa surgiu com o\nobjetivo geral de analisar a neuroeduca\u00e7\u00e3o e a tecnologia como parceiras emergentes no processo de ensino-\naprendizagem no contexto do s\u00e9culo XXI. A neuroeduca\u00e7\u00e3o e a tecnologia podem ser parceiras no processo\nde ensino-aprendizagem? \u00c9 o problema que move esta pesquisa.

Educa\u00e7\u00e3o.\nAbstract\nT echnology facilitates the lives of many people, and inserted in the educational environment, it provides\nthe teacher with different ways to streamline classes and make them interesting for students. Therefore,\nrethinking practices and the pedagogical process are routine ways of acquiring quality education. In the same\nway , neuroeducation and neurodidactics arise, which, as, as disciplines, increasingly strengthen teaching and\nlearning through the understanding of how the brain works. T o understand this dynamics is to offer students a\nmore elaborate class, rethought based on a lot of reflection. Therefore, this research emerged with the general\nobjective of analyzing neuroeducation and technology as emerging partners in the teaching-learning process\nin the context of the 21st century . Can neuroeducation and technology be partners in the teaching-learning\nprocess? It is the problem that drives this research. Finally , in this work, we will find the opportunity to\ngenerate reflections on the technology associated with neuroscience and its contribution to the educational\nprocess. It is up to the school, therefore, to adapt to these new moments, so there is no doubt that technology\nis a great resource for educational and social activities.\nKeywords: T echnology .

Ficou constatado que os professores valorizam essa tem\u00e1tica, sabem e\nreconhecem que a atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o profissional \u00e9 de extrema import\u00e2ncia. Acreditam que a uni\u00e3o da neuro-\neduca\u00e7\u00e3o com a tecnologia produzir\u00e1 efeitos positivos na educa\u00e7\u00e3o, pois trar\u00e1 uma maior diversidade\nde metodologia e de recursos necess\u00e1rios ao bom desempenho dos alunos e professores.\nPortanto, ao analisarmos o primeiro objetivo, \u201c1-Identificar os conhecimentos dos professores\nsobre a neuroeduca\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d, os professores opinam que a neuroeduca\u00e7\u00e3o e a tecnologia no processo\nde aprendizagem s\u00e3o parceiras no contexto educacional do s\u00e9culo XXI. Defendem a ideia de que\nos conhecimentos neuroeducacionais facilitam o aprendizado dos alunos e produz um aprendizado\ndiferenciado e significativo. O conhecimento do funcionamento das atividades cerebrais faz parte dos\nestudos neurocient\u00edficos; portanto, conhecer as tem\u00e1ticas da neuroeduca\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma forma de melhorar\no desempenho do professor em v\u00e1rios aspectos, bem como a melhoria do aluno em seu processo de\nensino-aprendizagem. Assim, a maioria dos entrevistados concordou e concordou muito com todos\nesses aspectos mencionados, como pode ser visto na T abela 1.\nSeguindo nosso estudo, analisamos o objetivo espec\u00edfico 2, sobre especificar a fun\u00e7\u00e3o do conheci-\nmento neurodid\u00e1tico dos professores para uma educa\u00e7\u00e3o emergente. Podemos observar na T abela 2\nque a maioria dos entrevistados concordam e concordam muito que a neurodid\u00e1tica \u00e9 relevante para o\natual contexto educativo, que os conhecimentos neurodid\u00e1ticos s\u00e3o essenciais para manter os profes-\nsores atualizados. Portanto, ampliar os conhecimentos em face da compreens\u00e3o cerebral no processo\nde ensino-aprendizagem permite ao professor melhorar e organizar suas pr\u00e1ticas de modo que produ-\nzam atividades que desenvolvam e despertem nos alunos as pr\u00e1ticas significativas. Nessa perspectiva,\nos participantes \u201cconcordam\u201d e \u201cconcordam muito\u201d com essas atitudes.\nNa T abela3, observamos o objetivo 3, que \u00e9 detalhar a import\u00e2ncia da tecnologia no processo de\nensino-aprendizagem.

A tecnologia permite aos docentes melhorar suas\nmetodologias, podendo renovar suas pr\u00e1ticas de forma segura e din\u00e2mica.
